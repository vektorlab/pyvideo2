New *and* Improved: Coming changes to unittest, the standard library test
framework

  
Presented by Michael J Foord

  
In Python 2.7 and 3.2 a whole bunch of improvements to unittest will arrive.
unittest is the Python standard library testing framework and for several
years it has languished whilst other Python testing frameworks have innovated.
Some of the best innovations have made their way into unittest which has had
quite a renovation.

  
This talk will go through the major changes, like the new assert methods, test
discovery and the load_tests protocol, and also explain how they can be used
with earlier versions of Python.
