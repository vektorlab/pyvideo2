Build tools are not very popular in Python environment. In this talk, I'd like
to show how useful it is to have one, even if you do just simple web
applications. A nice, single point of entry instead of hairy shell scripts,
fabric fabfiles and django admin commands all over the place.

Written in the neat, friendly Python instead of some Anty XML jumbo, you are
about to have a refreshing cleanup.
