When I set out to bring Django Girls to the city of Tijuana, I never expected to find so many programmers. Even more unexpected was a small group of Python/Django developers I found, passionate about kickstarting the Python community in Baja California. As Django Girls (and later, Django Girls Ensenada) came and went, I learned more about the Django community in other cities of Mexico, including the reason why I never heard of them before organizing the workshop.
