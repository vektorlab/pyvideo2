Title: 'Infinite 8-bit Platformer'

Infinite 8-bit Platformer is a Free Software multiplayer user-created-content
platform video game written in Pygame. It's a bit like a cross between a wiki
and a game, because the players can also create and edit the levels. In this
talk we will look at the development of the game over the last three years,
including what has changed since PyCon 2010. We'll examine the sound,
graphics, and networking architecture which is built upon pygame and asyncore
(PodSixNet).
