Title: 'Weather field warping using Python'
date: '2011-08-22'
---
Python is a great language for prototyping computer vision algorithms, the
availability of libraries such as Numpy and Scipy make for rapid development
similar to that of Matlab, R and IDL. At the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) we
are solving the interesting problem of weather field warping. Warping (aka
non-linear image registration) is used, for example, to determine what the
predicted temperature will be hourly if we only have predictions every three
hours
