Title: 'Easy site migration using Diazo and Funnelweb'
date: '2011-08-23'

Moving old sites into a new web platform is a pain. Often you need to pull
apart perfectly good HTML just to spend time painstakingly putting back
together again and converting hundreds of pages of content is a chore.
Recently PretaWeb used tools to drastically simplify this process when
converting genetics.edu.au to Plone 4.1. Diazo is a platform independent
theming engine that leaves HTML untouched. Funnelweb is a static content
migration tool for crawling and manipulating site content.
