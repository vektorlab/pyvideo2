Zookeepr [http://zookeepr.org/] is a comprehensive web-based conference
management system, written in Python and built on Pylons. It has an unusual
development history: custom created for the annual Linux.conf.au conference,
there are yearly spikes in event-focused feature development, but relatively
little of the ongoing development typically seen in open source projects.
