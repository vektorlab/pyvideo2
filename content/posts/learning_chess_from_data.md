Can empirical samples unveil the big picture?
Is chess games descriptions expose good enough data to gain understanding of chess rules - legal piece moves, castling, check versus checkmate, etc.
Which features are important in describing a chess game and which features are not. What is a good representation of a chess game for this uses.
What is the minimal sample size which is required in order to learn this in a good enough manner and where this learning can go wrong.


**Ne3  =>  E=mc2**

Looking at the bigger picture - Can we understand big systems based on empirical samples.
Can we reverse engineer physics and discover how physical system work based on no external knowledge beside empirical samples.
