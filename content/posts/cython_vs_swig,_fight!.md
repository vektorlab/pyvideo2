Title: '"Cython vs SWIG, Fight!"'
date: '2013-03-16'
---
Cython and SWIG are excellent, and yet very different tools for using C libraries from Python. The goal of this talk is to introduce both tools, discuss their strengths, their weaknesses, and the situations that clearly favor one tool over the other.
