While Java and C# use static type declarations to eliminate ambiguity,
the Python programmer must survive
through sheer clarity and consistency in naming variables.

that the Python community has developed and honed over two decades
to make Python code readable and meaningful within the freedom
that a dynamically-typed language grants us.
