Challenging students with interesting projects is an effective way to motivate them.  In this talk we will first discuss Kaggle, a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions on which companies and researchers post their data and statisticians and data miners from all over the world compete to produce the best models.  In particular, we will discuss the West Nile Virus Prediction challenge and how it is being used in the classroom.  Finally, this talk will get interested competitors started with some sample code.
