Haven't you always wanted to create a massively multiplayer, real-time game
for the browser? Or perhaps add chat to your website, or maybe write a real-
time financial application, collaborative text editor, or network health
monitoring app, all in the browser. Forget web frameworks; Orbited.TCPSocket
lets you communicate directly from a browser to any network server, with any
protocol you want. By tutorial's end, every attendee will have built their own
real-time data monitoring application, or multiplayer game, from scratch using
Orbited, Twisted, and js.io.
