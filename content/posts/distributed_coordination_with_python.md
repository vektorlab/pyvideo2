Title: '"Distributed Coordination with Python"'
date: '2013-03-17'
---
Processes in a cluster can require controlled access to shared resources, tracking available processes, and sharing state. Unfortunately most tools in this category are oriented around Java. In this talk I cover how to use Python to interact with Apache Zookeeper -- a fault-tolerant consistent data-store -- to write coordinated distributed fault-tolerant applications in Python.
