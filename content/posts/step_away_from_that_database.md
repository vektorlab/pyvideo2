Step away from that database

Presented by Andrew Godwin

A look at the large array of database types now available: where each one
excels, why NoSQL isn't always best, and the best ways to integrate them into
your Django project.

Abstract

In the last few years we've seen an explosion in the number of production-
ready databases available for web applications. From relational to document-
oriented, key-value and more, there's a staggering array of choice.

This talk covers the various basic types of database now available, and
highlights their weaknesses, their strengths, and the features you just can't
get from traditional databases.

Then, after a short rant about the term "NoSQL", learn how to best integrate
them into your Django projects, why being schemaless isn't as good as it looks
at first, and how relational databases are keeping up with the times.
