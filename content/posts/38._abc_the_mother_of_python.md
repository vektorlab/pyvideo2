Before Python, Guido was a contributor to the ABC language and environment.
ABC was designed to teach programming, and introduced many "Pythonic" ideas:
integrated dicts and tuples, structure by indentation, strong typing without
declarations etc. With high demand for Python in education, the legacy of ABC
is more relevant than ever as we design courses and environments for learners.
