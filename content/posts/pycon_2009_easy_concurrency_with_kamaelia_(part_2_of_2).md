[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ] Writing concurrent applications in Python is now becoming
not only easier, but quite elegant and simple, thanks to Kamaelia. Kamaelia is
an interesting component based framework originating from BBC research. It
accomplishes concurrent processing of data from and to many protocols.
Components easily connect and pass data from and to each other. We are going
to explore Kamaelia's strengths and possibilities, by running simple examples,
then trying nested protocol support, and maybe some other fun examples if time
permits.
