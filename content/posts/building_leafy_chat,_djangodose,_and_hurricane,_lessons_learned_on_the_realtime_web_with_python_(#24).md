Building Leafy Chat, DjangoDose, and Hurricane. Lessons learned on the real-
time web with Python

  
Presented by Alex Gaynor (Eldarion)

  
Websites are getting increasingly dynamic and realtime in order to compete
with desktop applications. This talk is an examination of 3 websites/tools
I've built, all using Python. I'm going to try to explain what we did to build
these, and how you can do the same.
