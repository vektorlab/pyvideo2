Python 101

Presented by Stuart Williams

This half-day tutorial presents the basics of Python to beginning and
intermediate programmers. It pairs well with ''Python 102'' which follows a
similar outline but goes much deeper.

Rather than starting with "Hello, world!", we use the interactive Python
interpreter shell to get hands-on familiarity with much of core Python before
covering blocks and scripts.

The tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and hands-
on exercises, to quickly cover lots of ground.

Advanced topics are introduced throughout and covered in "extra credit"
exercises such that more advanced participants can learn at their own pace.

Intended Audience

Programmers with experience in other languages who want a fast hands-on
introduction to Python. Content will target both Python 3.1 and 2.6.

Requirements

Bring a laptop computer with Python 2.6 or 3.1 installed. Try to get as much
of an overview of Python before the tutorial as you have time to in order to
get more out of the tutorial. Two angles on this are the Python Quick
Reference and the Python website's tutorial.
