Scaling Python past 100

Presented by Mark Ramm

Sourceforge.net has been in the top 100 sites on the internet, and we
discovered that python was easily able to scale up to handle that traffic. In
fact Python is now the core language for all new features, and is taking over
all of sourceforge.net.

Abstract

The path from legacy PHP to modern python tools has been long an bumpy, and
this is the story of how we took Python from a single prototype site, to the
core technology driving SourceForge.net. I will discuss the mistakes we made
along the way, the benefits that sold python, and the real secret behind our
python transformation.

A few highlights include:

  * How we abused libraries for fun and profit 
  * How a major mistake made us look good 
  * How the python community worked for us 
  * How we couldn't have done it without Django AND TurboGears
