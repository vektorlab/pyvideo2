Katie will demonstrate how to fire up an auto-scaling spatial app on OpenShift using Python and MongoDB, before hitting the app with some load to test the scaling spatial goodness.

**Abstract**

All over the web people are doing amazing things with spatial; this session will give you the necessary know-how to get started with your own cloud-based mapping app project. The talk will cover the basics of Platform as a Service and introduce Red Hat's open source OpenShift PaaS.
