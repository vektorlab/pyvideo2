Title: 'PyPy - is it ready for production?'
date: '2012-08-22'
---
I have followed the development of PyPy since 2004 and played with various
releases to see what the PyPy team had achieved. It wasn't until the release
of PyPy 1.18 that I actually ran some existing production python code under
it. The perceived performance improvement of this exercise inspired me to
implement a more scientific method for comparing the runtime performance of
CPython and PyPy running various Python production code sets that we use in
the company I work for. This presentation will discuss the results of this
comparison and the positives and negatives with utilising PyPy in production.
