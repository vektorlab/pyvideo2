Behave is a tool for behaviour-driven development inspired by the Cucumber
tool for Ruby. It allows developers and stakeholders to agree on how a
particular piece of software should behave using an English-like Given-When-
Then syntax and for that behaviour for then to be easily tested in whatever
manner is appropriate.

This presentation will provide an introduction to behaviour-driven
development, behaviour testing in general and the behave tool along with its
advantages over alternatives such as lettuce and freshen.
