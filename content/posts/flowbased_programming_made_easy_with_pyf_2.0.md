Title: '"Flow-based programming made easy with PyF 2.0"'
date: '2011-07-13'
---
PyF is a python framework to ease flow based programming and allow massive
data crunching on multiple CPUs. We boast an optional web-based interface to
visually design processing tubes, batch scheduling, report generation and
email alerts.

The Framework is easily extensible by writing plugins, a lot of features like
data persistence, reporting and web scrapping are already part of the
ecosystem.

This presentation will focus on an introduction to PyF architecture and
higher-level designer ui use and how it could be useful to you.

If available, an additional training session will focus on working with the
framework to create your own flow-based processes and plugins.
