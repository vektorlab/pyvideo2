Title: '"Introducing Django REST framework"'
date: '2011-07-13'

Django REST framework is a new project that aims to make it easy to build
RESTful Web APIs.

The APIs it creates are fully Web browse-able, using an awesome Django admin
style interface, allowing them to be truly self-describing, well-connected
systems.

The talk will include:

  * RESTful Web APIs and Django - what batteries aren't in the box
  * An introduction to the framework - What it is, what problems it tries to solve
  * Why it's so important that Web APIs should be Web browse-able
  * A live coding demonstration
  * Audience discussion
