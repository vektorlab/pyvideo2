Django is an excellent web development platform with an extensive developers
community. It may be the most popular Python web framework nowadays. However,
the exisiting django based CMS products are not as feature complete as other
comparable solutions (Drupal, Plone, Alfresco, ModX, etc.).

The Merengue project tries to fill this gap. It is financed by the University
of MÃ¡laga (Spain) and takes advantage of existing code and knowledge from
other projects (Plone, Drupal, Pinax, django-cms, feincms, LFC, etc.)
