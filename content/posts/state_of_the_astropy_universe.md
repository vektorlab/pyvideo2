The [Astropy Project](http://www.astropy.org/) is a community effort to develop a single core package
for Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between Python astronomy
packages. In addition an ecosystem of [Astropy affiliated packages](http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html) is
growing, some of which are planned for inclusion in the Astropy core when
they are matured, some with specialised functionality will remain as
separate repositories.

I will give an overview of the features and implementation of the Astropy
package, focusing on parts that are more generally useful for scientists and
engineers (e.g. [astropy.units](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/units/index.html) and [astropy.modeling](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/modeling/index.html)) and highlight recent
developments in the core and affiliated packages.
