This intermediate-level class will teach you techniques using the popular
NoSQL database MongoDB, its driver PyMongo, and the object-document mapper
MongoEngine to write maintainable, high-performance, and scalable
applications. We will cover everything you need to become an effective
MongoEngine/MongoDB developer from basic PyMongo queries to high-level object-
document mapping setups in MongoEngine.
