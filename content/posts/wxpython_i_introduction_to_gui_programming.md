wxPython I: Introduction to GUI Programming

David Goodger

wxPython is an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that runs on
multiple platforms, including Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. By the end of this
tutorial, attendees will have built a simple form-based application from

the choices and rationale as we go.
