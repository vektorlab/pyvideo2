Python in quantitative finance

  
Presented by Wes McKinney (AQR Capital Management, LLC)

  
This talk will show how Python and libraries such as NumPy were instrumental
at AQR for building a robust research platform for prototyping and
implementing quantitative trading models. We will discuss many different
tools, including pandas, a new open source library designed for analyzing
common financial and economic data sets.

  
A variety of examples will be presented to explore Python's current status as
a replacement for other statistical computing environments (as compared with
R, MATLAB, or other commercial and open-source statistical products).
