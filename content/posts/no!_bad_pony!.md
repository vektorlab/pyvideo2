The Django community is not short of ideas that could be added to the core
repository. Some of these ideas are great, and are just waiting for the right
implementation or the attention of a core developer. Other ideas are just not
going to happen. However, it's not always obvious why an idea will be
rejected. This talk will attempt explain the reasoning behind a couple of
specific decisions. More broadly, this talk will aims to provide general
guidance on the decision making process of the Django core. It will also
address how you can get started contributing to Django.
