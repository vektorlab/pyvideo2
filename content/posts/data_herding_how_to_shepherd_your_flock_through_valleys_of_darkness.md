Data Herding: How to Shepherd Your Flock Through Valleys of Darkness

Presented by Brian Luft

Learn how to use common tools like the management shell, django-extensions,
and iPython to craft an effective workflow whether you're building a new
schema or migrating from old systems. We'll also look at how to take advantage
of the latest ORM features.

Abstract

The presentation would consist of walking through a few example scenarios
where one would deal with processing or converting data in some manner. For
example, migrating from a large legacy database often brings a number of
tedious problems. I would demonstrate how to work in an iterative, repeatable
style using the Django sql management commands, a few iPython tricks, etc.

Another demonstration would be showing a team workflow for South migrations,
illustrating how to deal with some common problems that crop up in practice.

The audience will leave with some solid techniques for dealing with a few
specific data management challenges. The unifying philosophy throughout is to
break large, difficult problems into small, repeatable steps and audience
members should also come away knowing how to select tools that help them work
in this style.
