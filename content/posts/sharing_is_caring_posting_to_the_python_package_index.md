Due to its robust namespacing, Python uniquely equips developers to write and
distribute reusable code. The Python community has a tool for this: the Python
Package Index. PyPI is a massive repository of code, and in this talk you'll
learn how to take code that you've written it and register and distribute it
for use by others.
