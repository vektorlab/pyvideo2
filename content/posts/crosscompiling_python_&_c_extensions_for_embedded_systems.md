Title: '"Cross-Compiling Python & C Extensions for Embedded Systems"'
date: '2012-03-10'
---
Cross-compiling is not a use case directly supported by the Python build and
extension system. This talk will discuss the process of building python for
your embedded platform, and the basics of getting C extensions compiled and
running. It will focus on Linux so that the build host and the build target
are the same.
