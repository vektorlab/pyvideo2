Plone for Python Developers

Presented by Dylan Jay (PretaWeb)

Plone is one of the top four open source CMSes in the world and is pure
python. Plone is in demand for security, simple UI and extreme flexibility.
This talk will concentrate on helping web programers with several common
customisations of Plone, including content type creation, themeing and
template customizations and how the re-architecture using ZTK makes this easy.
