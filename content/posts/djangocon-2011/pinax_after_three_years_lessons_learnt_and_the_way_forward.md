Pinax after three years: Lessons learnt and the way forward

Presented by James Tauber

The Pinax platform has had its ups and downs since it was launched in 2008.
People either love it or just don't get it. About the only thing everyone
agrees on is that it doesn't seem to be progressing as fast as it once did.
This talk will take a fresh look at the goals of Pinax, what we did well, what
we didn't do so well and what we're (slowly) doing to fix it.
