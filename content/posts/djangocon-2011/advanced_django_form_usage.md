Advanced Django Form Usage

Presented by Daniel Greenfeld, Miguel Araujo

Django forms are really powerful but there are edge cases that can cause a bit
of anguish. This talk will go over how to handle many common solutions not
currently described in the core documentation. It will also cover some useful
third-party libraries and will end with clarifications about what the state of
form features will be in Django 1.4.
