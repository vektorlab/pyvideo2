State of the DSF Keynote

Presented by Russell Keith-Magee

For this keynote Russ will be providing some background on what the DSF is,
what it has been up to recently, and what it plans to do over the next year.
If you're interested in contributing to the Django community, this will be a
great way to find out what opportunities are out there and to find out how the
DSF can help.
