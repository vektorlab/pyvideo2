(Presented with Matteo Bertozzi)

Python's high development speed and Qt's gargantuan feature set allow for
comfortable development of complex desktop applications. Still, what does one
need to do to best leverage this awesome combination? And more importantly,
what crucial advantages exist to decide its adoption in favour of more
traditional tecniques?

During this training, we'll start from a white canvas and show how to develop
a desktop application using the best tools Qt offers. You'll learn how to
compose complex GUIs from basic building blocks, and how to use QPainter, one
of the most advanced 2D painting systems in the open source world. Qt's Webkit
integration will be discussed, along with the recent Qt Quick technology,
which allows one to create smooth and fluid user interfaces. Qt's solution to
common deployment problems, like handling a serious translation workflow, will
be presented. At the end, we'll package our PyQt application so it's ready to
be distributed for download.

Walk away with a sound understanding of why you should choose PyQt for your
next desktop project.
