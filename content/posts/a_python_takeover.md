Two years ago I started working on SourceForge with a couple of python
developers. Back then the site was written in PHP and was in some ways buried
in technical debt. Everything is different today, we have a complete set of
tools for Ticket tracking, Wiki documents, Git, Mercurial, Subversion, and IRC
- all written in Python, and now released as open source software.

This is the story of how the amazing libraries, tools, and talent in the
Python web community has radically changed an established company, and allowed
us to reinvent sourceforge.net.

This talk will go over our tech stack, talk about the libraries we used, the
way we solved scalability, internationalization, and performance issues
issues. Ultimately we know that without python, we could not have built a
flexible plugin based system, and gotten permission from management to open
source it.
