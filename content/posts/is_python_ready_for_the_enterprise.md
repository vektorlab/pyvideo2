Title: '"Is Python ready for the Enterprise?"'
date: '2015-08-04'
---
There seems to be an opinion among some developers that Python isn't suitable for Enterprise. To put it another way, Python is great for small tasks where a scripting language works well, but not so suitable for more complicated software stacks. This talk tries to address some of these concerns. Specifically, we will look at:

* Python Typing System for large code bases.
* Is the GIL a problem?
* The speed of Python execution.
* The speed of Python development.
* A case study: Caterpillar.
