First steps in performance tuning

Presented by Russell Keith-Magee

So you've built your first Django website. You've tested it, you've released
it, you've got a few customers... and a few more... and a few more... and now
you're having performance problems. What do you do? This talk will look at
some performance problems you may experience, and show some simple (and
creative) ways to squeeze the most out of your server hardware.

Abstract

The talk is especially aimed at web developers that haven't got a background
in computing, but nonetheless have fallen into a web development role. Topics
will include:

  * How to work out that you have a problem 
  * Getting computation out of the request/response loop 
  * Caching -- when, how, and problems that caching introduces 
  * Setting up a webserver to avoid deadlocks 
  * Likely causes (and solutions) of database bottlenecks
