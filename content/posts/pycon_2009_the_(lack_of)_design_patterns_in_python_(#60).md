The (lack of) design patterns in Python

  
Presented at PyCon 2009 by Joe Gregorio

  
There is a distinct lack of Design Patterns discussed in relation to Python.
Are the communities ignorant of Design Patterns or is there something else
going on here? This talk is based on my well-trafficked article "Python isn't
just Java without the compile" and expands on that article by using Design
Patterns as a crude metric of gaps in a programming language.
