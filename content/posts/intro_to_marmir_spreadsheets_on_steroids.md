Marmir ([https://github.com/brianray/mm](https://github.com/brianray/mm))
takes Python data structures and turns them into spreadsheets (think xlwt on
steroids). This is a high level Intro to the project, current status, goals,
and to solicit any contributions. This talk will look into how Marmir
internals do things like: measure fonts to fit columns, preserve data types
(dates, numbers), allow advanced look and feel customization of spreadsheets.
Later down the road, I would like to have a separate talk on Marmir internals
and how it may be customized to do things like, convert Django model data
directly to spreadsheets, integrate with google spreadsheets.
