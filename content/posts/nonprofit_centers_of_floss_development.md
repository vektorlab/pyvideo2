Title: 'Non-Profit Centers of FLOSS Development'
date: '2012-03-09'
---
Free, Libre & Open Source Software (FLOSS) began as a not-for-profit endeavor.
FLOSS licenses permit commercial & non-commercial activity, but the heart of
FLOSS remains in the not-for-profit space. Kuhn will discuss advantages of
non-profit structure and how non-profits facilitate neutral territory. Kuhn
will also present options for projects that seek to operate officially as a
non-profit org.
