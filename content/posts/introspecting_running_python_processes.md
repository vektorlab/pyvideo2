Title: '"Introspecting Running Python Processes"'
date: '2012-03-09'
---
Understanding the internal state of a running system can be vital to
maintaining a high performance, stable system, but conventional approaches
such as logging and error handling only expose so much. This talk will touch
on how to instrument Python programs in order to observe the state of the
system, measure performance, and identify ongoing problems.
