Scaling Python webapps from zero to 50 million users - A top-down approach

Presented by Jinal Jhaveri

LOLapps is one of the top providers of social games and user generated
applications with 50+ million monthly uniques on Facebook, MySpace and Bebo.
This session will focus on the top-down approach we took to scale our webapps
for millions of users. Here are the 6 topics we will cover:

  * Why is performance a big issue for Social Media 
  * How we profiled our apps and found bottlenecks using custom developed and existing middleware 
  * The web application best practices we applied and results obtained 
  * How we traced database connection leaks 
  * Our caching strategies and the changes we made to speed up the memcache client 
  * Results of our experiment using Paster and Tornado as our web servers.
