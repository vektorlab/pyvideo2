Get new contributors (and diversity) through outreach

Presented by Asheesh Laroia

Groups like the Fedora Design Team, Dreamwidth, SF Ruby, and OpenHatch have
discovered the power of outreach to bring in new contributors. In the past
year, SF Ruby grew in numbers as well as in diversity, moving from 3% women to
18% women. Because most projects need ongoing help, this talk discusses
effective strategies for bringing in contributors who stick around for the
long haul.

Abstract

This talk is targeted at anyone involved in an open source project who wants
to find more contributors.

Programs like Google Summer of Code often provide excited students who
disappear after a summer's work. Meanwhile, request for help emails on
development lists are typically met with silence. Hackathons create a flurry
of commits, but then we never hear from the participants again. Expanding your
team is possible, and it requires care in terms of outreach, expectation
management, and mentorship.

We will discuss three major forms of outreach:

  * One-on-one check-ins with participants, 
  * Periodic drives to bring in new contributors, and 
  * In-person teaching events. 
Each one has "do"s and "don't"s associated with it. This talk digests the
experience of effective outreach into practical strategies that you can re-use
within your project.
