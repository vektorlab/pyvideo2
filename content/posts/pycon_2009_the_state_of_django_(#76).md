Django 1.0 was released in September 2008. This release marks a major turning
point in Django's development; a real maturation of the project. Join the lead
developers of Django as they discuss what's new in Django 1.0, cover the
Django 1.1 release (currently scheduled for a few weeks before PyCon), and
discuss the project's future.
