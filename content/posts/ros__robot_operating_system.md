ROS is the Robot Operating System, originally from Stanford and now supported
by Willow Garage. ROS has a mature Python interface and is being used around
the world by both amateur and professional roboticists. At the end of the
presentation, if time allows and interest exists, some rudimentary ROS
functionality will be demonstrated on a robot in progress.
