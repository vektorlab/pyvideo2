Title: '"New beauty in Camelot"'
date: '2011-07-13'
---
Camelot is a Python framework that leverages SQLAlchemy and QT to build rich
desktop applications. The model - view definition used was inspired by the
Django Admin interface. Some see it as a replacement for MS Access, but it's
underlying libraries allow much more advanced features.

In this talk we will focus on the changes and new features that were
introduced in Camelot and more importantly, how they can be used in your
applications. Those features range from Matplotlib chart integration and new
types of actions to displaying custom SQLAlchemy queries in a table view.

We will share our experiences with large scale deployment of Python and
Camelot applications to the desktop of the user. In a number of case studies
we will point out the mistakes we made and how they were corrected.
