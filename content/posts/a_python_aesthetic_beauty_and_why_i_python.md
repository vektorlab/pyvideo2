date: '2012-11-10'
---
Why did I start using Python in the late 1990s? Was it for any of the reasons

training us to avoid and become blind to its rough edges, works to teach us
new ways of making programs beautiful. Even novices should learn new things to
love about Python by listening to this talk!
