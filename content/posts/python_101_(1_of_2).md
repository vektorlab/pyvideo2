Python 101 (Part 1 of 2)

  
This 2 part tutorial presents the basics of Python to beginning and
intermediate programmers. It pairs well with Python 102 which follows a
similar outline but goes much deeper. Rather than starting with "Hello,
world!", we use the interactive Python interpreter to get hands-on familiarity
with much of core Python before covering blocks and scripts. The tutorial is
divided into short sections, each with presentation and exercises, to quickly
cover lots of ground. Advanced topics are introduced throughout and covered in
"extra credit" exercises such that more advanced participants can learn at
their own pace.
