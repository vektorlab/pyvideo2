The ``cryptography`` library emerged in 2014 with the goal of
becoming Python's "cryptographic standard library".  It is designed
to be easy to use but flexible, exposing a *recipes* layer for
common use cases, and a *hazmat* layer that provides crypto
primitives but demands users know what they're doing in order to use
them properly.

This talk will explain the motivations and goals of the
``cryptography`` library, take a tour of its features and discuss
its implementation.  ``cryptography`` will be compared to some other
popular and emerging crypto libraries.  Finally, we will examine
some real-world use of the library.

Audience members should have a passing familiarity with cryptography
(e.g. know the differences between hashing and encryption, or public
key and private key crypto) to get the most out of this talk.
