Dealing with unsightly data in the real world

Presented by Alexander Dutton

Drawing on experiences writing [http://m.ox.ac.uk/](http://m.ox.ac.uk/), we'll
explore the art of getting data out of unhelpful systems. We'll start with
working out how to interact with a system, move on to techniques for parsing
the data it gives you, and round off by implementing a shinier interface over
the top.
