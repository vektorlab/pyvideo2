Extreme Network Programming with Python and Linux

Presented by Rob Ludwick

Traditionally, C is the preferred language for low level network programming
and works well for those who have the time and patience to work with it. As it
turns out, Python is very capable for prototyping low level network code,
collecting data, and testing ideas quickly without getting lost in the land of
C.

Abstract

While not as robust as C, Python provides a simple and elegant solution for
many cases to either prove a theory or gather data before developing a more
robust solution. Obscure topics such as raw sockets, multicast, network
bridging, rolling your own vpn, and disruption tolerant networking will be
covered. Use of Python can enable building a custom protocols, debugging a
network, fixing broken nets, custom logging and processing, and simulation of
networks. The author will talk about his experiences using Python on Linux for
extreme network programming and possibilities for future efforts.
