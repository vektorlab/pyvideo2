Title: '"How the PyPy JIT works"'
date: '2012-03-10'
---
The Python community is abuzz about the major speed gains PyPy can offer pure
Python code. But how does PyPy JIT actually work? This talk will discuss how
the PyPy JIT is implemented. It will include descriptions of the tracing,
optimization, and assembly generation phases. I will demonstrate each step
with a example loop.
