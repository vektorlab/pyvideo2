The Big F'ing Tutorial: Development Using repoze.bfg Web Framework (Part 3 of
3)

  
Presented by Chris McDonough

  
Are you a Python web developer who thinks there might be some great stuff
hidden away in Zope but you consider it inaccessible to you because you feel
that Zope imposes too many foreign concepts for your tastes? Are you a more-
or-less happy Zope developer that has the nagging feeling that much of Zope is
unnecessary "baggage" on your current project? Maybe you're a Plone developer
who feels that Plone is unsuitable for one of your current projects because
it's too complicated? This tutorial will present everything you need to know
about repoze.bfg, a small Python web framework in the spirit of Pylons. The
goals of repoze.bfg are simplicity, familiarity to Zope programmers (but no
Zope experience is required), execution speed, and complete, comprehensive,
and up-to-date documentation. In this tutorial, we'll explain the core
concepts in repoze.bfg, then we'll lead a guided development session where we
make a small application using the framework. We'll also cover packaging and
deployment of the application. Questions are highly encouraged during the
presentation.
