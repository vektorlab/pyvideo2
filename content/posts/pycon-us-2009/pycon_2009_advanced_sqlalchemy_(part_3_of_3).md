SQLAlchemy is the premier SQL toolkit for Python. SQLAlchemy exposes the full
power of SQL while remaining easy to use for the basics, and is flexible
enough to work with existing database schemas as well as fresh designs.
SQLAlchemy is used in production by leading Python web frameworks Pylons and
TurboGears as well as many other web and non-web developers. This tutorial
discusses current data mapping techniques, advanced Query techniques,
Session/transaction usage, and maximizing schema usage with SQLAlchemy's event
model.
