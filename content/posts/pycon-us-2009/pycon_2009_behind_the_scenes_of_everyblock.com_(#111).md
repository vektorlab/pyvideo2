PyCon 2009: Behind the scenes of EveryBlock.com by Adrian Holovaty

Adrian Holovaty, bad-boy YouTube guitar star (search for him, if you dare!)
and co-author of the Django web framework, takes you under the hood of
EveryBlock.com, a Knight Foundation News Challenge startup which rounds up
local news and information, and is powered 100% by Python and Django.
