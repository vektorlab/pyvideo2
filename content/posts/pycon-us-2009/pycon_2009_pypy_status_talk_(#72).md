PyPy Status Talk

  
Presented by Holger Krekel and Maciej Fijalkowski

  
PyPy has come a long way. It's gone from being purely a research project to
providing a flexible and reasonably fast Python Interpreter, itself
implemented in Python. Although PyPy is not yet a viable CPython replacement,
PyPy is able to run sophisticated python applications like Django and Twisted.
In this talk, we'll focus on improvements that happened during the last year
in PyPy. This talk will also explain the motivations driving current PyPy
development and its targets for the future.
