[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: 2 speakers, 1 mic.] Although often used as a "scripting"
language, Python is an object-oriented programming language at its core. This
tutorial is designed for programmers who are familiar with Python yet new to
the concept of object-oriented programming. We also welcome programmers who
are experienced with other object-oriented languages yet new to Python. We
will begin the tutorial by introducing the general principles of object-
oriented programming. We then focus on Python's treatment of object
orientation. The tutorial will be organized as a mix of formal presentations
together with hands-on demonstrations and exercises. Take your Python
programming to the next level!
