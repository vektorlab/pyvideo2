Have you conquered the basics of Pylons/TurboGears2 (or just taken the morning
class)? Do you want to understand more about how everything works, and how you
can go beyond the basics to understand how to customize things? This class
will take you from a basic understanding of how to use the framework, to a
clear picture of how the framework pieces are put together. I will also cover
how to create REST+JSON based web services, we'll focus particularly on how
all this works with rich javascript based user interfaces, but the techniques
should easily apply to Flex, or other "Rich Internet Application" tools.
