Title: '"pytest - rapid and simple testing with Python"'
date: '2012-03-09'

The py.test tool presents a rapid and simple way to write tests. This talks
introduces common testing terms, basic examples and unique pytest features for
writing unit- or functional tests: assertions and dependency injection
mechanisms. We also look at other features like distributing test load, new
plugins and reasons why some Redhat and Mozilla people choose pytest over
other approaches.
