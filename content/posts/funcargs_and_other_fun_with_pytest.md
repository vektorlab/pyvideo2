Title: 'Funcargs and other fun with pytest'
date: '2012-08-22'

Pytest is a mature and comprehensive testing suite for Python projects, but it
can be a little intimidating for newcomers. Where do these mysterious funcargs
come from, how do parametrised tests work, and where are my xUnit-style setUp
and tearDown methods?

Pytest lives by "convention over configuration" - which is great once you know
what the conventions are. This talk will look at real examples of pytest in
use, emphasising the features that differentiate it from nose.
