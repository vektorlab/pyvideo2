Python projects can succeed or fail because of their documentation. Thanks to
Sphinx, Python now has a “documentation framework” with indexing, syntax
highlighting, and integration with your code. Students will be given a small
undocumented Python package, and during the exercises they will give the
package a tutorial and reference manual. Plus: deployment and theming!
