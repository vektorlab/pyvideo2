Using Python for Natural Language Generation and Analysis

Presented by Tennessee J Leeuwenburg (Australian Government Bureau of
Meteorology)

Python is used within the Bureau of Meteorology to automatically generate
weather forecast text based on numerical data. In addition, the development
team has also used Python to introspect the forecast language and statistics
used in the past. NTLK is an open-source language processing toolkit which can
be used for visualising language patterns. This presentation will talk about
some of the techniques used for automatically describing datasets and also how
NTLK can be used to discover information about language uses and requirements
in an organisation.
