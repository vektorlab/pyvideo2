Turbogears Database Applications (Relational Database Applications)

Presented by Chris Perkins

TurboGears2 provides a rich toolset to provide developers with a platform for
developing web applications with existing databases. This â€œun-tutorialâ€
has a simple goal. The participants may bring in their own databases, and we
will explore how TurboGears can use this database to create a working web
application. If the student does not want to use her own database, one will be
provided. This tutorial will focus on the TurboGears Admin system, along with
relational databases.

This tutorial is intended to be an un-tutorial. The idea is simple. Bring a
public database, (or 4) and share with the class as we explore the new admin-
level RESTful features that TurboGears2 employs.

At the end of the class, the goal is for everyone to have a working TG2
application, with a working admin, at least one customized form or table,
based on a database they, or another student brought to class.

Requirements

Laptop with Python 2.5 or 2.6 installed. Database system of your choice
(Postgres, Sqlite, MySQL) Python drivers for your desired database system
installed. (psychopg2, pg8000, pysqlite, mysql-python)
