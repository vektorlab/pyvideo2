Title: '"32. Python in Computer-Aided Drug Discovery "'

Computational tools are an integral part of the modern drug-discovery process.
At NIBR, we leverage Python to great success in all stages of drug discovery.
Not only can we easily deploy new tools to our scientists easily using tools
like Django, but Python's approachability (that "fits your brain" character)
allows scientists with no programming experience to start coding themselves!
