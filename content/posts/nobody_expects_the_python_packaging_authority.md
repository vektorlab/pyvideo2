These are interesting times for the Python packaging ecosystem, with the Python Packaging Authority (creators of the popular pip and virtualenv tools) emerging as the umbrella brand for a suite of related tools that will bring support for updated packaging standards to both the upcoming Python 3.4 and to existing versions of Python.

This talk will cover some of the history of Python's packaging tools and systems, where we are now, and where we aim to go in the future.
