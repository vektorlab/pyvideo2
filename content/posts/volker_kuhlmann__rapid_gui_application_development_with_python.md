Rapid GUI application development with Python

Presented by Volker Kuhlmann

Abstract

Options and tools for rapid desktop GUI application development using python
are examined, and how they compare to competing languages and platforms.

Outline

Examine GUI options for python including Qt, and their performance with
respect to ease of use, runtime, and platform portability. Examine options for
the tool chain (IDE, editor, debugger, programming aids) and characterise
their ease of use and level of sophistication, and compare with commonly used
equivalents, both open source and not open source. Demonstrate a sample
program.
