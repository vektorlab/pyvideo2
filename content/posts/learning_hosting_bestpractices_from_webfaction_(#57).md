Learning Hosting Best-Practices From WebFaction

  
Brandon Craig Rhodes (Rhodes Mill Studios, Inc.)

  
The rise of WebFaction has been dramatic in the world of Python-friendly
hosting services. What are the secrets to getting the most out of their
features? From the point of view of a customer with no other affiliation with
WebFaction â€” as a customer advising other customers â€” this talk offers
lessons learned in using WebFaction to host everything from lone static
content to multiple Python web applications and services co-existing together.
WebFaction uses some unique techniques to support both user-local *and*
application-local Python packages. Should you use their special installation
techniques, or install and use virtualenv on your own initiative? Learn the
trade-offs, and learn how *not* to get yourself in trouble while running
``easy_install`` on WebFaction, my favorite hosting service.
