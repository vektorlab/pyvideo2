Django is a great tool for creating powerful database-driven web applications
quickly. The ORM, form processing, the admin interface, and wealth of
community applications make Django the right tool for a number of situations.

One thing that Django doesnâ€™t do well is make it terribly easy to create
highly-interactive, dynamic interfaces. There are solutions that people are
working on. This talk will be about using Django with Backbone.js to help
create these interfaces. Backbone.js is a Javascript framework that, in many
ways, sees the world in the same way as Django. These two tools can complement
each other nicely.

Topics:

  * Similarities and differences in how the two frameworks see the world
  * Creating REST interfaces with Django REST Framework
  * Tools to ease the interface between Django and Backbone
  * Templating strategies
  * Shortcomings and implications on accessibility
