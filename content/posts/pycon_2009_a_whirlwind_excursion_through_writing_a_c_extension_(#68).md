[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Ambient mic used, some echoing] Everyone's heard of C
extensions to Python, but few have ventured into those murky depths. This is a
quick overview of how to write a C extension, complete with highlights of the
C API, memory management, error handling, and type creation. Whether you want
to speed up your Python, integrate with legacy code, contribute to Python's
core, or just learn a little about how it all works under the covers, you will
enjoy this trip through unfamiliar territory. I guarantee you will return
safely.
