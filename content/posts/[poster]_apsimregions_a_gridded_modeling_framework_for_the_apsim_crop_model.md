Title: '"[Poster] ApsimRegions: A Gridded Modeling Framework for the APSIM Crop Model"'
date: '2013-03-17'
---
This poster demonstrates how Python can be used in the Environmental and Earth Systems Sciences to create a framework for automating the process of preparing input, running in parallel, and processing output from existing computer models. The framework discussed, ApsimRegions, uses many built-in and third-party Python packages to accomplish these tasks specifically for the APSIM crop growth model.
