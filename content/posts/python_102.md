Python 102

Presented by Stuart Williams

This half-day tutorial presents intermediate and some advanced features of
Python to beginning and intermediate programmers. It pairs well with Python
101 which follows a similar outline but at a more introductory level.

Rather than starting with "Hello, world!", we use the interactive Python
interpreter shell to get hands-on familiarity with much of core Python before
covering blocks and scripts.

The tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and hands-
on exercises, to quickly cover lots of ground.

Advanced topics are introduced throughout and covered in "extra credit"
exercises such that more advanced participants can learn at their own pace.

Intended Audience

Programmers with experience in other languages who want a fast hands-on
introduction to intermediate and some advanced features of Python. Content
will target both Python 3.1 and 2.6.

Class Outline

  * Numbers and Strings - operators, functions and methods 
  * Introspection 
  * Sequences - overview, concepts, and methods 
  * Objects 
  * Dictionaries 
  * Files 
  * Classes 
  * Namespaces 
  * Dynamic Classes 
  * Iterators and Generators 
  * Functions 
  * Exceptions 
  * Standard Library 

Requirements

Bring a laptop computer with Python 2.6 or 3.1 installed. Try to get as much
of an overview of Python before the tutorial as you have time to in order to
get more out of the tutorial. Two angles on this are the Python Quick
Reference and the Python website's tutorial.
