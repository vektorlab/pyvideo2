This intermediate-level class will teach you techniques using the popular
NoSQL database MongoDB, its driver PyMongo, and the object-document mapper
Ming to write maintainable, high-performance, and scalable applications. We
will cover everything you need to become an effective Ming/MongoDB developer
from basic PyMongo queries to high-level object-document mapping setups in
Ming.
