rdflib is a python library implementing a database with various triples back-
end, parser, data serializers, SPARQL is a Python interface to extract/insert
triples. We integrated it in Django reusing the database connection and
exposing an ORM interface, along with full-text search on literals. This
presentation shows a django-rdflib case study with a PostgreSQL backend in
[Brain Architecture Management System](http://brancusi1.usc.edu) - a
neuroscientific project for the University of Southern California. Benefits of
the flexible RDF structure will be shown, allowing researchers to insert free
format data, making data public with a customizable serialization and use the
powerful full-text search integrated in PostgreSQL.

Objective: show attendees an effective combination of RDF, PostgreSQL full-
text search and Django ORM via django-rdflib.

Requirements: Django familiarity.
