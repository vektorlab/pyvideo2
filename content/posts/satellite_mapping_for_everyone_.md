Title: 'Satellite mapping for everyone '
date: '2015-04-11'

Concerned about urban sprawl, landscape change or ecosystem recovery? Wildfire, drought or flooding? A vast amount of satellite data, collected since the 1970s, is freely available for your next mapping project. I will demonstrate how Python helps to make sense of odd scientific data and metadata formats and produce beautiful visualization and map products.
