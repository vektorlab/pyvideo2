This talk evaluates a well-known free software tutorial (the official Django
tutorial) from the perspective of a web development novice in order to point
out omissions and common sticking points and suggest improvements. More
generally, this talk is useful to anyone looking to improve their project's
tutorials and other newcomer-targeted documentation by approaching them with
"beginner's mind".
