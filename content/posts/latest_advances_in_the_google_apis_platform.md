Title: '"Latest advances in the Google APIs platform"'
date: '2011-07-18'
---
This talk will give an outline of the advances that Google have made in API
delivery over the last year, and how it is relevant to you as a Python
developer. The talk is suitable for beginners and advanced developers.

We will describe the underlying platform, and the built-in features that all
Google APIs inherit.

We will focus on how the Python libraries for this API platform are generated
and can be used as a single library that doesn't require updating with API
updates, as Python lends itself perfectly to the nature of this platform.
