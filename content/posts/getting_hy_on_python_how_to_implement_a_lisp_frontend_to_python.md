Title: 'Getting Hy on Python: How to implement a Lisp front-end to Python'
date: '2014-04-12'

This talk will cover the internals of Python, such AST, Import hooks, creating a console, and a very brief overview of Python internal formats (such as pyc files), by way of looking over the implementation of a Lisp called "Hy". No Lisp knowledge is required.
