Title: 'There were 986 roadway fatalities in Illinois in 2013. Where''s the data?'
date: '2014-01-09'

Seen on garish LED roadway signs all around Chicago on New Year's Eve, 2013: 986 TRAFFIC DEATHS IN 2013. It leads to many questions: On what roads? When did the accidents happen? What do we do now? I'm scared to drive. I will talk about purging my fears by finding the data to answer some of those questions. http://tothebeat.github.io/fatal-car-crashes/ This talk will involve PythonAnywhere, IPython, a module that's not even on PyPi (dbfpy), searching for and finding open government data, CartoDB, Google Fusion Tables, csv, and maybe Pandas. Rest assured, there will be no graphic photos.
