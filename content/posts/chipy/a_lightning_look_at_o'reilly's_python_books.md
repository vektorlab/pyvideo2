Title: 'A lightning look at O''Reilly''s Python books'
date: '2014-12-11'
---
Wouldn't it be awesome if ChiPy wrote its own book? We'd be able to get BEvERages for weeks, maybe months on the royalty! If so, we'd need to see what's already out there.

This lightning talk takes a look at O'Reilly's Python books using requests and BeautifulSoup, with a little of scipy's hierarchical clustering on the book descriptions. It is presented in an iPython notebook.
