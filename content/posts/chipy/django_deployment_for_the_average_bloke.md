This is the config you want to use if you don't know what you want to use. You
don't need to make any choices, you don't have to do any research, and you
don't even need to read the docs if you don't want to. And as an added bonus,
I show how to wget a vm image to deploy into with network ports exposed. It is
very much like working with a hosting provider like Slice Host, and it makes a
great framework for testing server installs.
