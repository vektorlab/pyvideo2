Title: 'Vintage 1978 Superboard II hacking with some Python3 and ZeroMQ'

I'm not sure if we're still looking for talks on Thursday, but if so, I'd like
to volunteer to give a talk about using Python to do some retro-computing
hacking involving my vintage 1978 Superboard II. It's not exactly robotics,
but it involves hardware and a lot of low-level hacking (along with some
Python3 and ZeroMQ thrown in for good measure ;-).
