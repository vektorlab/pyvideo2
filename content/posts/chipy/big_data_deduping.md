Title: 'Big Data De-duping'

Derek Eder of Webitects and Forest Gregg, a Ph.D. student of sociology at the
University of Chicago, will describe the Python library they are developing to
deduplicate tabular data, quickly, accurately, and at a large scale. The
library facilitates the matching of related records in different data sets,
using a machine learning approach. They expect to have a demo to show and will
explain how they expect that the library will be used.
