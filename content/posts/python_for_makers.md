Digital fabrication is the art of translating digital designs into physical
objects. Using personal machines that are controlled via software, a live
demonstration of CNC milling and 3D printing will also be performed. This talk
is a walkthrough from 3D models to machine motion, that shows how we can use
Python to write GCODE generators that create endless form.
