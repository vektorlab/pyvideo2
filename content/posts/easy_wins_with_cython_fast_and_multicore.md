Python has often been criticised for slow runtime performance, and for the GIL which prevents multi-core concurrency. Cython provides tools for addressing both issues, and in a way that is simple enough for the average programmer to use.

This talk will show:

- How to get started with Cython
- Tools to make day-to-day Cython work easier
- How to dramatically speed up a slow function
- How to distribute work over multiple CPU cores
