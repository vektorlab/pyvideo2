A common complaint about Django, the leading Python web application framework,
is that it doesn't make writing REST APIs easy enough. In fact the paradigm
for a typical Django application involves views which map to HTML page
templates. With end users increasingly expecting rich interfaces with the
responsiveness of a desktop application, this paradigm is being superseded.
Fortunately a third-party Django application called Piston fills the gap.
Django/Piston can be combined with the Ext JS JavaScript framework and widget
set to create attractive, responsive Web applications, and this talk will show
you how.
