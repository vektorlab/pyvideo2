In financial engineering and derivatives analytics, C/C++/Java/VBA and other
languages are still dominating. Visixion has developed with
[DEXISION](http://www.dexision.com) the first full fledged derivatives
analytics suite with Python as core language.

DEXISION is an On Demand application that is completely Open Source based
(LAMP). For derivatives valuation, it uses Monte Carlo simulation - an
approach known to be computationally demanding. However, Numpy provides the
performance and functionality needed to implement financial simulation
algorithms in a fast and compact manner.

The talk illustrates the architecture of our analytics suite and demonstrates
how to implement fast and compact simulation algorithms with Python and Numpy.
The talk shows that the Python/Numpy combination reaches sufficient speed for
productive financial applications - something still widely doubted.
