Multiple, Heterogeneous Models in Pylons

Presented by Nick Seidenman (WEHI)

There is a fair amount of sparse, disjoint information available on how to use
multiple, possibly diverse databases within a single Pylons app. This talk
seeks to present a coherent guideline, derived from lessons learned, on how to
use several different data stores (sqlite, postgresql, mysql, flat files)
simultaneously within the same pylons project.
