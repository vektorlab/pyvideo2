Python Goes to the Movies

Presented by Mark J Streatfield (Dr. D. Studios.)

As Hollywood continues to churn out blockbuster films such as Avatar, the
technology used to produce the eye popping visual effects is increasingly

foundation of Python. This talk introduces the application of Python in the
visual effects industry.
