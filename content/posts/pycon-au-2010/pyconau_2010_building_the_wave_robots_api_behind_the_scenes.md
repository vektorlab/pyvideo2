Building the Wave Robots API: Behind the Scenes

Presented by Pamela S Fox (Google)

The Google Wave robots protocol involves JSON-RPC messages that are sent
between the Wave server and the robot, communicating events to process and
operations to perform. The Python Robots API abstracts on top of that JSON-RPC
service, allowing developers to interact with waves using event callbacks,
python classes, and chained functions. In this talk, we'll explain the JSON-
RPC protocol, talk about how we designed the API to sit on top of that
protocol, and show how developers can use the API.
