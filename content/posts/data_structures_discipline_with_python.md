Title: '"Data Structures Discipline with Python"'
date: '2015-05-29'
---
Data Structures is traditionally a “bogeyman” discipline in Computer Science courses and has a high degree of failure. In FATEC São José dos Campos we are adopting a hybrid approach, with C and Python languages. The failure rate decreased from 85% (2008) to 12% (2014). The talk will be extensively illustrated with code in C and Python, addressing the various concepts taught in this course.
