Title: 'Bayesian statistics made (as) simple (as possible)'
date: '2012-03-07'

This tutorial is an introduction to Bayesian statistics using Python. My goal
is to help participants understand the concepts and solve real problems. We
will use material from my book, Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for
Programmers (Oâ€™Reilly Media).
