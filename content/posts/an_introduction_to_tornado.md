An Introduction to Tornado

Presented by Gavin M. Roy

Tornado is an open source version of the scalable, non-blocking web server and
tools that power FriendFeed. It is not only a web server but it is a light-
weight, use only what you need, web development framework. In this talk we
will review the current state of the Tornado project, review the features
Tornado provides and give examples of how to implement asynchronous web
applications in Tornado.

Abstract

Tornado is an open source version of the scalable, non-blocking web server and
tools that power FriendFeed. It is not only a web server but it is a light-
weight, use only what you need, web development framework. In this talk we
will review the current state of the Tornado project, review the features
Tornado provides and give examples of how to implement asynchronous web
applications in Tornado.

Topics covered will include:

  * Core Tornado concepts 
  * Building an asynchronous web application 
  * Using the Tornado template engine 
  * Database Interaction 
  * Secure cookies and Sessions 
  * Utilizing built-in OAuth Clients for Authentication 
  * Websockets 
  * State of asynchronous drivers available to Tornado 
  * A light introduction to Tornado internals
