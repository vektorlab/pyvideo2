Alice in Performanceland -- Down the Rabbit Hole with Frank Wiles

Presented by Frank Wiles

While pre-optimization is often the root of all evil, knowing how to think
about performance and scalability are important skills for any geek. Learn
about all the knobs you didn't know you could or should tweak.

Abstract

Code profiling and dealing with your database aren't the only places to find
performance gains. Performance and scalability are holistic endeavors.
