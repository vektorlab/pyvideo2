Looking at the most successful open source projects we have been seriously impressed by the importance of Docker: it is positively revolutionizing the DevOps industry. Docker is a valid alternative to the traditional virtual machines and it is redefining the IT service deployment.

Thanks to the available Docker APIs, we have witnessed a remarkable proliferation of tools based on the same APIs to efficiently manage virtual infrastructures: a place of honor, among of all of these, is reserved to the libraries and tools written in Python.

This talk is divided into two parts:

* The first part provides an introduction to Docker by illustrating a typical use case: a network of micro-services aimed to manage a web application.

* The second part goes into detail on how to write Python code which will be able to orchestrate Docker images and containers.
