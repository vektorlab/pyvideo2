Title: 'Making DISQUS realtime'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
This talk will overview what it took to add realtime to a truly “web scale”
app. The result is the DISQUS realtime system, a highly concurrent system for
allowing web clients to subscribe to arbitrary events in the DISQUS
infrastructure. The talk will be about 30 minutes with an extended
Question/Answer/Open discussion time (because your ideas are good too!).
Overview of the architecture (redis + gevent + flask) and why those choices
were made Numbers! how much concurrency and msg/s we are supporting with
realtime How we baked high availability into the application, not just the
infrastructure Overview of the hardware involved Lessons learned (what broke
hard, what worked awesome) Suggested audience experience: Medium/Advanced
level experience Familiarity with Flask, Gevent/Eventlet would be really good.
