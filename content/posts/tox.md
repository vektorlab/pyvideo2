Here's our Hudson matrix setup w/ tox: [http://hudson.testrun.org/job/nose-
unstable/](http://hudson.testrun.org/job/nose-unstable/) (we just set this up
recently which is why most builds were broken in one or two envs) I can also
spend some time going over how we are currently maintaining a test suite that
runs in both 2.x and 3.x simultaneously.

This will be our Best Meeting Ever!
