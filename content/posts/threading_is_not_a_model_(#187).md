Threading is not a model

  
Presented by Joe Gregorio

  
We have many concurrency/multiprocessing capabilities at our finger tips, such
as threads, processes, locks, mutexes, select, epoll, transactional memory,
etc. But none of them are a model for multiprocessing, they are only tools on
which you would build an implementation of such a model. So what are the
models we can choose from? How would they be implemented in Python? And why
may the GIL actually be a good thing?
