Title: '"Test Driven Deployment with Nose Test and IPython"'
date: '2015-06-09'

Devops gospel is widespread, but what happens to big legacy infrastructures? The switch to Continuous Delivery is hard:

* customers are reluctant to disruptive changes;
* old operation teams must adapt to new technologies.

Weâ€™ll show how a light Test Driven approach to system delivery allowed us to:

* reduce software updates time;
* eliminate maintenance issues;
* contribute to open source;

The operation team had no troubles thanks to the fast learning curve of python.

The library we contribute has been included in Red Hat 389 Directory Server.
