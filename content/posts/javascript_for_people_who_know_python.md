Javascript for people who know Python

Presented by Ian Bicking

Javascript as a diff on Python.

Abstract

You know Python. You should know Javascript. The two aren't so different, but
this talk will explain exactly how they are different -- lists, dicts,
objects, functions, loops and all the other details of Javascript described in
terms of Python.
