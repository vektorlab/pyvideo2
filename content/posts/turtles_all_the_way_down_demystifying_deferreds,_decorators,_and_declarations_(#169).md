Turtles all the way down: Demystifying deferreds, decorators and declarations

  
Presented by Glyph Lefkowitz

  
Python's flexible object model allows library and framework authors to add
very flexible declarations. Metaclasses, decorators, callable objects, and
operator overloading practically allow libraries to re-define the language in
order to provide a more concise, natural style for that library.
Unfortunately, the library user's first experience of such conveniences is
often confusing, because it's not clear what's going on.

  
In this talk, I will try to convince you that all of this wonderful magic
isn't all that weird. This is not a typical how-to session on how to use a
particular feature, either of Python or of Twisted, but will rather draw
examples from Python, Twisted, and Zope to illustrate techniques you can use
to read and understand "magical" Python code.
