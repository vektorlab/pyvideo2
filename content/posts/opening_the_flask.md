Opening the Flask

Presented by Armin Ronacher

After a year of the Flask microframework it's time to draw some conclusions,
see things that went right and things that should be improved. The talk gives
both an introduction into Flask itself as well as well as the ecosystem that
evolved around it.

Abstract

Flask is a microframework that was born out of an April's fool joke that
quickly became more than that. Based on the powerful foundation of Werkzeug
and Jinja2 it's one of the most popular frameworks for Python now.

The talk starts with a very quick introduction into Flask, where it all
started and why I think people like it. We will look into the design of Flask
and why it works the way it works.

Furthermore we will look into the Flask ecosystem and how extensions work and
have a brief look in what is planned for the future, especially regarding
Python 3.

The talk assumes basic knowledge of web applications.
