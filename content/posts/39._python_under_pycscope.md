Title: '"39. Python under PyCScope"'
date: '2012-03-11'
---
CScope has been around for years, and is a very useful tool to get a handle on
C source code. Pycscope is an attempt to bring those benefits to the world of
Python. Unfortunately, the existing version is woefully out of date. We take a
walk through an attempt to update it, correct some flaws and make it more
generally useful to us, while giving us a view into the Python parser.
