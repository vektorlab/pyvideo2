ipython was a big focus of Scipy:  Fernando gave a keynote, Brian gave a talk, and there was a tutorial. 

 ipython appeals to a broad audience from beginners to advanced users. "IDLE is awful and I basically learned Python using iPython" says Jason, whose presentation will touch on the powerful features and extensibility for advanced users.
