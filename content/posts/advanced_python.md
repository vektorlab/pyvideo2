This tutorial will work through a series of real-world examples, showing how
an understanding of the tools built into the Python interpreter or included in
the standard library can be combined to solve difficult problems clearly and
Pythonically. We will also discuss when and how to reach beyond the standard
library when needed to address difficult algorithmic and optimization
problems.
