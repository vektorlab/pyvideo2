Deconstruction of an Object

  
Presented by Jeff Rush (Tau Productions Inc.)

  
An incremental deconstruction of a class definition identifying the key
elements such as layered namespaces, common attributes, lifecycle and access
controls. We'll also look at calling into, out of and through an object,
making classes extensible and various object behaviors like containment,
sequence, iteration and arithmetic.
