Why not run all your tests at all the time? A study of continuous integration
systems

  
Presented by Dr. C. Titus Brown (Michigan State University)

  
There are an increasing number of continuous integration (CI) systems
available for use by Pythonistas, but no clear guide to how to choose a CI
system for your project. I will examine the architecture choices made by
buildbot, bitten, Hudson, continuum, CruiseControl, DART, and pony-build, and
discuss the configuration and customization of several of these systems for
Pythonic needs, as well as give short demos (for buildbot, bitten, Hudson, and
pony-build).
