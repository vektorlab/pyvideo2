How to write cross-interpreter Python programs

  
Presented by Maciej Fijalkowski (merlinux GmbH, pypy)

  
This talk will cover basics about writing cross-interpreter python programs.
What to do and most of all what not to do. This will help you if you want at
some point in time to run program on for example Java platform or faster
python interpreter, but also if you want to keep it running between CPython
releases.
