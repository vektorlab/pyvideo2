# Intro

  * Django's version of MVC vs. iOS/Android version of MVC
  * How the platforms differ from Django
  * What is similar to Django

# API

  * Easiest way for Django to be used in conjunction with mobile today
  * Big fat requests with lots of data preferable to many smaller requests
  * Authentication best practices for mobile backend APIs

# PhoneGap

  * Can actually use Django to build your mobile app today
  * JavaScript tricks to get around things like tap delay
  * How much Django is really used vs. how much JavaScript
  * Offline caching
  * Performance issues with this approach

# Future

  * Quick look at RubyMotion
  * Turns out it's possible to cross-compile Python for iOS
  * Android has Py4A (including interpreter embedding)
  * What can be done with this? Mobile Django.

# Conclusion

  * They are different worlds, need to be careful to respect both
  * Even today Django proves useful as an API layer
  * Django web apps in native wrapper can be a solution, albeit with its issues
  * As hardware gets better, we may see something like an embedded Django
