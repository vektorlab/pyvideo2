Title: '"The SQLAlchemy Session - In Depth"'
date: '2013-03-15'
---
A detailed walkthrough of SQLAlchemy's Session, describing the rationale for its existence, its driving philosophies, and finally a walkthrough of Session lifecycle through the use of an animated diagram.  We'll cover how the relational database refers to database rows within a transaction, and how the Session has over the years developed a tight, proxied integration with this lifecycle.
