Blender 2.5 loves Python 3

Presented by Chris Webber on October 8th, 2009

Chris talks about the upcoming Blender 2.5 release. "Blender 2.5 is the first
app I know of that *requires* Python 3.X. So that's pretty interesting on its
own. But there's plenty more interesting stuff to discuss. It's going to be
mostly an overview talk. Blender's python integration could possibly span 3
separate talks, especially considering the blender game engine's use of it,
which is a separate but interesting talk."

ChiPy is a group of Chicago Python Programmers, l33t, and n00bs. Meetings are
held monthly at various locations around Chicago. Also, ChiPy is a proud
sponsor of many Open Source and Educational efforts in Chicago. Stay tuned to
