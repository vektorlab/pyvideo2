Title: 'Experimental pure mathematics using Sage'
date: '2015-04-11'
---
Pure mathematics is not always big formulas written on endless notebooks, it can also be hidden behind python code. In combinatorics, we study classical computer science objects like trees or graphs with a mathematical perspective. This talk aims to show how computer exploration and experimentation can be used to discover and prove new mathematical results.
