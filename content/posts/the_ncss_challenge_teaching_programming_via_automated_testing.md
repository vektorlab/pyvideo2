Title: 'The NCSS Challenge: teaching programming via automated testing'
date: '2011-08-22'
---
The NCSS Challenge (http://challenge.ncss.edu.au/) is an online programming
competition for Australian high school students. There are four different
courses being run during 2011: Introductory Python, Intermediate Python,
Advanced Python, and Embedded Systems (using the Arduino). In 2010 we had over
1700 students participate in the Challenge. There are a number of interesting
technical challenges which had to be overcome in order to facilitate such a
system.
