Exhibition of Atrocity

Presented by Mike Pirnat

Believe it or not, but you can write pretty horrendously awful code even in a
language as elegant as Python. Over the years, I've committed my share of
sins; now it's time to come clean. Step right up for a tour of twisted, evil,
and downright wrong code, and learn some strategies to avoid writing
criminally bad code--if you dare!

Abstract

What does it look like when good intentions go horribly wrong? This talk will
take a tour through pathological code from my past (as well as some
contributions from friends, coworkers, and the community), featuring such
terrors as:

  * Lies, Damn Lies, and Hungarian Notation 
  * Crimes Against PEP-8 
  * The Diaper Pattern 
  * The Beast With a Thousand Elifs 
  * The Mile-Long Club 
  * God Objects and God Methods 
  * The Malignant Menace of Mutable Keyword Arguments 
  * The Seductive Lure of Global State 
  * Slower Applications Through DTO Bondage 
  * A Twisty Maze of Single-Character Variables, All Alike 
  * Lambdas, Lambdas Everywhere 
  * The List Comprehension That Ate Cincinnati 
  * Adventures in Wheel Reinvention 
  * New and Creative Ways to Break the Build 

...as well as others as time permits.
