Title: '"Lexical Graphs with Natural Language Processing using NLTK"'
date: '2014-01-09'
---
Brian will talk about his experiences using Python and NLTK http://nltk.org/ to run language comparisons to generate lexical difference graphs like the one mentioned in the "Lexical Distance Among the Languages of Europe" article. http://bit.ly/1cS46Ba

The focus will be on the NLTK and how its internals work to process a language. This talk will be his best one ever.
