Title: 'Distributed, Real-time Web Apps with Stack.io'
date: '2012-11-11'
---
Stack.io[1] is an open-source tool to quickly build real-time web apps. By
directly linking clients to back-end services via WebSockets, Stack.io helps
decompose complex code into a set of simple components in Python or Node.js.
It augments standard RPC with bi-directional streaming, and provides a layer
of auth and service discovery on top.
