gevent-socketio is the cross-framework python implementation of the Socket.IO
protocol, based on Gevent's cooperative concurrency model. Alexandre Bourget
is the maintainer of the project.

In this talk, we're going to have a live demo of its capabilities building
Google Analytics in 45 minutes, with some AngularJS on the front-end, and
other cool integrations.

Black chocolate will await you.
