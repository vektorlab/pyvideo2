Title: 'The SQLAlchemy Session - In Depth '
date: '2012-11-10'
---
A detailed walkthrough of SQLAlchemy's Session, describing the rationale for
its existence, its driving philosophies, and finally a walkthrough of Session
lifecycle through the use of an animated diagram. We'll cover how the
relational database refers to database rows within a transaction, and how the
Session has over the years developed a tight, proxied integration with this
lifecycle.
