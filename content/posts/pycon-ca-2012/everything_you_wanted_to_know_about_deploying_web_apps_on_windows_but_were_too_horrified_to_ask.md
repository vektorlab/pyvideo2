Title: 'Everything you wanted to know about deploying web apps on Windows but were
  too horrified to ask'
date: '2012-11-10'
---
Conventional wisdom says that no one deploys web applications on Windows. I
ship Python backed web sites on Windows that are cumulatively visited by 1 in
50 Canadians every month. This talk will cover my experience with deploying
Python based web applications on Windows, why you might want to do this and
and the horrors in store for you if you choose to sacrifice your sanity and
dive in.
