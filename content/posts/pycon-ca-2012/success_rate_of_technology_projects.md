Title: 'Success Rate of Technology Projects'
date: '2012-11-11'

Why do some projects fail and some succeed? Is it about technology and quality
of developers?

I will be advocating that the success or failure of a given technology project
will be dependent on factors frequently outside of control of development
team.
