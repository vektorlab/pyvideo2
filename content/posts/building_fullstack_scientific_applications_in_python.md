Title: '"Building full-stack scientific applications in Python"'
date: '2013-03-16'
---
Python has a large collection of tools for scientific computing.  However,
finding the right pieces and assembling them into a fast and scale-able app can
be a daunting task.  This talk will explore common requirements of scientific
apps and how to fulfill those from the Python ecosystem.  It will also provide a
blueprint for building apps using tools like PyQt, PyQwt, numpy, and HDF5.
