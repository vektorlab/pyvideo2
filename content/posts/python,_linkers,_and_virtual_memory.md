Title: 'Python, Linkers, and Virtual Memory'
date: '2012-03-11'
---
Why does “top” show that your Python process uses 110 MB of virtual memory but
has a resident set size of 9 MB? Does it consume more memory to spawn several
interpreters, or to run one Python and have it fork() further workers? What is
an “undefined symbol,” anyway? Learn about how an operating system manages
memory, loads shared libraries, and what this means for Python servers and
applications.
