In many Python circles, Twisted is the recommended framework for all
networking and multitasking applications. Twisted provides a powerful,
extensible event-driven framework with built-in support for many network
protocols. But without due care, Twisted’s event-driven features can result in
code that’s a nightmare to read and maintain. In this presentation, I will
review the basics of Twisted, and show some of the features which make Twisted
such a popular framework. I’ll share my experiences debugging and maintaining
mission-critical Twisted applications, discuss some of the pitfalls to avoid
when coding with Twisted, and present tips and tricks for debugging Twisted
code and writing Twisted code that’s a pleasure to read and maintain.
