This report analyzes practical example of Clope clusterization algorythm, as a way of building model database using similar items given unknown cluster quantity. I will try to shed some light on Python's advantages and drawbacks in this task's implementation as well as some ways of scaling, optimizing and distributing the calculations, using alternative implementations of Python(PyPy, Stackless, etc.).
