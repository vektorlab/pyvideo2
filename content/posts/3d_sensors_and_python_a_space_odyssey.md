This talk will start with a brief introduction to 3D Sensors and OpenNI. Then we’ll surf into PyOpenNI,  features such as the skeleton, hand and gesture tracking, RGB and depth video. Every topic will be presented with practical demos. The talk will end with a demo integrating WebGL (THREE.JS), 3D sensors, Flask and ZMQ to produce a simple fully open source based NUI game.

Some simple demos of PyOpenNI and PyGame can be found at [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI2ktioiPY8) and [2](http://youtu.be/3e8jibGUQ2Q)

Attendees will not only learn about game related technologies but also about innovative ways of doing domotics, cinema & art, Interactive visualization, scientific research, educations, etc.

3D Sensors will be available for testing during the event - you can get yours for about 80 to 140 Euros (depending on the brand). Slides and demo code will be available at Github.
