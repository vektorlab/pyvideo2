The requirements and expectations towards deployment and operations are
advancing at an incredible pace. Especially the DevOps community encourages
and demonstrates how system administrators can leverage methods from other
areas of expertise to achieve classical goals: fewer outages, more
flexibility, lower cost, higher security standards, improved reproducability
and overall increased quality. The hosting of complex, traffic-intensive web
applications nowadays requires a solid and flexible infrastructure: you need
to take care of all the homework first before going into the nitty gritty
details of your specific application. My talk shall demonstrate the aspects we
meet on the infrastructure and service level when deploying and operating
complex services. I’ll show-case how we approach the problems we face to
prepare for an ever-improving future. As many people and companies are
experimenting with different approaches today, I’d love to spawn a separate
discussion, maybe in an open space, to talk about why you do something
different from us and what your experiences are. The topics will specifically
include: infrastructure versus service, data center operations, make-or-buy,
automation, virtualisation, monitoring, help desk, SLAs, deployment checklist,
staging, secrets, HTTP/S termination, load balancing, reporting As you can
see, the talk’s topics are mainly focused on methods and lines of thought.
However, if you’re interest in tools - I will also mention the following on a
varying level of detail: puppet,

    haproxy, nginx, apache, varnish, supervisor, cron, Linux, DELL, ProCurve, KVM, Nagios, RT, fabric, zc.buildout, batou
