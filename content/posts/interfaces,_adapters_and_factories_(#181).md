Interfaces, Adapters, and Factories

  
Presented by Jeff Rush

  
A step-by-step introduction to the idea of object interfaces and adapters
using incremental code examples, based on the zope.interface module. The case
for adaption to ease code brittleness will be made and how we can reason about
interfaces. I'll show how to automatically check code for conformance to your
interfaces and then cover where objects come from, the several kinds of object
factories in Python and how one kind can be based on interfaces.
