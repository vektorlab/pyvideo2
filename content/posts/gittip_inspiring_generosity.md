Gittip is a platform for sustainable crowd-funding. The site's primary funding mechanism is the "gift tip," a small, anonymous, weekly gift to a worthwhile person or project. These gifts are given with no strings attached, and represent a new model for funding free and open source software. Moreover, Gittip itself is funded on Gittip, with potential implications far beyond software.
