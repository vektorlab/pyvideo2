There are many deployment options for Python code. I'll share what has worked
well for me on Windows, packaging command line tools and services using py2exe
and InnoSetup. I'll demonstrate a simple build script which creates windows
binaries and an InnoSetup installer in one step. In addition, I'll go over
common errors which come up when using py2exe and hints on troubleshooting
them. This is a short talk, so there will be a follow-up Open Space session to
share experience and help each other solve distribution problems.
