Title: '"Making Apache suck less for hosting Python web applications."'
date: '2013-03-16'

Is there a valid basis to such claims or have they simply been misguided by the views of others? This talk will endeavor to shine a light on the realities of and limitations in working with Apache, as well as the challenges in implementing the mod_wsgi module for Apache.
