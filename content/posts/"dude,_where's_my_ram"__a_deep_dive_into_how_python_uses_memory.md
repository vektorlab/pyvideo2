"Dude, Where's My RAM?" - A deep dive into how Python uses memory

Presented by Dave Malcolm

This talk will give a deep dive into how CPython uses memory. I'll be
demonstrating a new tool I've written that analyses CPython's memory usage,
and offer hints and tips on how you can reduce the memory footprint of your
Python programs.

Abstract

Is your Python program using too much memory? This talk will give a deep dive
into how CPython uses memory - starting from objects in your Python code, down
through the various implementations layers, eventually reaching actual
hardware.

In particular, I'll be demonstrating a new tool I've written that can track
CPython's memory usage down to the level of individual bytes, and offer hints
and tips on how you can reduce the memory footprint of your Python programs.
