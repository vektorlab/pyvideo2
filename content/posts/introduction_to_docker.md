Docker is a tool for sandboxing entire application environments using Linux containers. Docker's feature set includes versioning, sharing etc. They are light-weight and fast, you can recreate a deployment environment in development or push your development containers to production. Imagine never having to worry about fragmentation of servers or syncing the versions of different libraries.
