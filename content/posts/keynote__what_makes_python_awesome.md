Title: '"Keynote - What Makes Python Awesome"'

Raymond Hettinger, a Python core developer for over decade,
offers his perspective on what differentiates Python from
other scripting languages.

Ten years ago, Python was equal to other scripting languages
in terms of its expressiveness.  Since then, it has pulled
very far ahead using a number of advanced technologies:
list comprehensions, iterators, generators, generator
expressions, decorators, context managers, metaclasses,
and abstract base classes.

Each of these capabilities were added in a way that respected
the language's reputation for readable, beautiful code.
Together, the toolset offers unique capabilities for
rapid application development and maintainable code.
