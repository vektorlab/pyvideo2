While fabric is a great tool for systems automation, saltstack is better. When Geoff decided to re-work the procedure at Trinity College for doing their regular package installs using salt, he ended up writing his own script that interacted with salt. He learned to love how testing improved his ability to debug this script without breaking his production environment, and wants to share what he learned with you.
