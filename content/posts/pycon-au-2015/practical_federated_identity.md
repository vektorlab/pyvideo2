Title: 'Practical Federated Identity'
date: '2015-08-04'
---
Federated Identity was once again a highlight of the OpenStack summit in Vancouver this time with the announcement of keystone to keystone federation that will pave the  way for inter-cloud workloads. 

In the past I have done presentations on what Federated Identity is, however in this talk we delve into the more practical requirements of connecting to an IdP, discuss the changes in workflow required to authenticate your applications, how to configure web single sign on with horizon, what is possible today and the pain points you may encounter using federation.
