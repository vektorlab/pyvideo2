Title: 'JSON Standards for the Web'
date: '2015-08-04'

RESTful APIs reign supreme! No longer do developers have to put up with SOAP
and XML-RPC and those bulky, schema laden exchanges. JSON maps almost directly
to python and we're flying again!

Over time the chaos of free form JSON representations has subsided and a number
of best practices have appeared such that we now expect certain patterns when
encountering a new JSON REST API. The next step is to standardize these
practices and start offering the predictability and code reuse we lost years
ago.

The talk will provide an overview of current attempts at standardizing JSON
exchanges such as jsonapi, jsonhome and jsonschema.
