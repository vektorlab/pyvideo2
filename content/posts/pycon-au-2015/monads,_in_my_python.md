Title: 'Monads, in my Python?'
date: '2015-08-04'
---
Monads shouldn't be difficult to understand. This talk aims to show what monads are, and why you shouldn't be afraid of them. You most likely use them already (yes, really). 

In this talk, I'll touch briefly on category theory (don't worry, it's not scary), and a couple of practical implementation of monads. You don't have to be a functional programmer or a Haskeller to use monads.

Lastly I shall attempt to lay out a good rationale to use more monads when programming in Python
