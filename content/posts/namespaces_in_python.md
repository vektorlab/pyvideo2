Title: 'Namespaces in Python'
date: '2013-03-17'
---
In the infamous words of Tim Peters, "Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!" (PEP 20)  Python's type system is built on the basis of well-bounded namespaces.  Come look behind the curtain and you'll see Python in a whole new light.  We'll also talk about how to put this knowledge to use whenever you write modules, classes, and functions.
