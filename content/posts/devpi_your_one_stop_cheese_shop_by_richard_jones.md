Modern Python developers depend on a large number of 3rd party packages. This in turn introduces a problem: how to manage those packages for rapid, reliable deployment in a world where the central repository - PyPi (the Cheese Shop) - is out of their control. Additionally, private packages may be developed which need to seamlessly be integrated into the deployment systems.

In this talk I will present devpi, a PyPI (Cheese Shop) server and packaging/testing/release tool. I will cover its reasons for existing, its many capabilities and configuration for some common scenarios.
