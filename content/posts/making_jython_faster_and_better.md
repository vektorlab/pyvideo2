As a dynamic language, Python is difficult to optimize. In addition, these
dynamic features make using Python code from Java currently too complex.
However, Java 7 adds the invokedynamic bytecode and corresponding library
support, making it possible to finally address these problems in Jython. This
talk will describe work in progress to make Jython faster and better
(improving Java integration).
