Ten Years of Twisted

Glyph Lefkowitz

The Twisted event-driven networking engine is well-known in the Python
community. However, only a few of its features are widely understood. This
talk will be a brief conceptual introduction to Twisted, followed by a survey
of its features, their status, and how development has been proceeding over
the years, with a special focus on the last two years of sponsored
development.

Abstract

This talk will begin with a brief introduction to Twisted architectural
concepts; a description of the event loop, connections, and timers. It will
then segue into the many different features that Twisted offers, including
command-line tools for running an out-of-the-box zero-configuration HTTP
server, DNS server, IRC server, and SMTP server. This will also present the
relative maturity and stability of each of these areas of the code, with a
special emphasis on what level of expertise a developer should have before
attempting to use them. Finally, I will describe some of the features that
have been added to Twisted along the way, including some new and exciting
developments that have been happening recently.
