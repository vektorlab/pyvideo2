Creating RESTful Web Services with restish

  
Presented by Grig Gheorghiu

  
Roy Fielding described REST in his Ph.D. dissertation in the year 2000. Almost
ten years later, Web developers are still confused as to how to apply the REST
principles in their applications. Examples of poorly designed 'REST' APIs
abound, and I will make use of them in my talk.

  
In this presentation, I will give an overview of REST and its design
principles, and I will show a concrete example of a RESTful Web service
implemented in the restish framework. My examples will include CRUD
operations, as well as transactions. I will also show how to consume this Web
service using both httplib2 and curl. I would be remiss if I didn't describe
ways to test the Web service with WebTest and twill.
