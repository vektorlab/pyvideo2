We will show how to build simple yet powerful RPC code with ZeroMQ, with very
few (if any!) modification to existing code. We will build fan-in and fan-out
topologies with ZeroMQ special socket types to implement PUB/SUB patterns and
scale up job-processing tasks. Thanks to introspection, the resulting services
will be self-documented. Finally, we will show how to implement distributed
tracing.
