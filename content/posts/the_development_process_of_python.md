Python is an open source language, where everyone can contribute, and thanks
to Mercurial now it's even easier. With this talk I want to unveil what
happens "behind the scenes" of CPython and how you can get involved and be
part of the open source community that allows Python to be one of the most
popular programming languages.

I will explain:

  * what is the workflow of the CPython development;

  * how to get a clone of Python;

  * how to use Mercurial to do all the most common operations;

  * what is the structure of the main CPython repository;

  * what other are repositories are used;

  * how to use the bug tracker to report and find bugs;

  * how to use remote Mercurial repos to contribute code;

  * what tools are used;

  * how to get in touch with the core developers;

  * what are the plans for the future.
