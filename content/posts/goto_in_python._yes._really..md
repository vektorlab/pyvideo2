**Audience level**

Experienced

**Description**

Unfortunately, python is missing the goto keyword. This talk rights this historical wrong by presenting a module that allows the use of goto within a function. An overview of the implementation is provided, along with rationale and performance results. Knowing what a decorator is will be helpful for understanding the technical part of this talk.

**Abstract**

goto in Python

 - A brief history of the goto statement.
 - Why have a goto in Python?
 - Previous attempts at goto in Python
 - Dynamically rewriting byte codes
 - Problematic constructs
 - Performance results
 - Future work
