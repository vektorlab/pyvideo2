Title: 'Finding Spammers & Scammers through Rate Tracking with Python & Redis'
date: '2015-04-12'
---
This talk provides an introduction to rate tracking as well as an explanation of a particularly cool way to implement it. You will learn what rate tracking is, why you would want to do it, and then how you can use build a Redis-backed “velocity engine”  in Python to do just that.
