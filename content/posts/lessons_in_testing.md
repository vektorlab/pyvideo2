Title: 'Lessons in Testing'

Testing can be one of the more difficult concepts to pick up in a development
cycle. With the complexities of large projects, and even small projects,
writing effective, automated tests can take many times longer than writing the
code and testing it by hand.

This talk will explore the various patterns of testing that DISQUS has
implemented, and iterated upon over the last two years. It will describe how
testing has been used to speed up the product lifecycle, improve stability
through automation, and the culture shift required to get there. Most
importantly, it will cover the practices that have been put in place that have
helped ease the burden of writing tests.
