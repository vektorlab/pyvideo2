Title: 'Why you should use Python 3 for text processing'
date: '2013-03-16'
---

String (and byte) objects have grown some handy methods and some built-in functions have improved or been added.  More importantly, refinements and additions have been made to the standard library to cover  the most common tasks in text processing.
