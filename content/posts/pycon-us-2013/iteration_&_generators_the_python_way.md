Title: 'Iteration & Generators: the Python Way'
date: '2013-03-17'
---
Did you know that "for a, (b, c) in s:" is a valid Python line? From the elegant for statement through list/set/dict comprehensions and generator functions, this talk shows how the Iterator pattern is so deeply embedded in the syntax of Python, and so widely supported by its libraries, that some of its most powerful applications can be overlooked by programmers coming from other languages.
