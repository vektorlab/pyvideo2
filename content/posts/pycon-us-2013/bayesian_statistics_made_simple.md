Title: 'Bayesian statistics made simple'
date: '2013-03-13'
---
An introduction to Bayesian statistics using Python.  Bayesian statistics are usually presented mathematically, but many of the ideas are easier to understand computationally.  People who know some Python have a head start.

We will use material from Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers (Oâ€™Reilly Media), and Think Bayes, a work in progress at http://thinkbayes.com.
