Title: 'Integrating Jython with Java'
date: '2013-03-16'
---
Jython provides a nearly seamless integration when using Java
code. Using Jython from Java is not nearly as seamless, at least not
yet. There are also several choices, depending on what you're doing,
from object factories to using Java Scripting (JSR-223) support. This
talk will discuss techniques, gotchas, and ongoing work to improve integration.
