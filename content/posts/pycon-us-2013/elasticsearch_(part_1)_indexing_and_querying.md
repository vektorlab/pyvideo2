Title: 'Elasticsearch (Part 1): Indexing and Querying'
date: '2013-03-15'
---
Elasticsearch provides an easy path to clusterable full-text search, with synonyms, faceting, and geographic math, but there's a paucity of written wisdom beyond its API docs.

With the groundwork laid, we explore how to choose efficient indexing and the right queries to make your apps go fast.
