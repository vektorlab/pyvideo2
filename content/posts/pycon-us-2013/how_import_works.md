Title: 'How Import Works'
date: '2013-03-17'
---
This talk will go over how the simple ``from sys import version`` turns out to be slightly complicated. The details of imports -- from how the import statement is interpreted to deciding what object to return -- will be discussed. While the talk will discuss things from the perspective of Python 3.3 (and thus importlib), the overall semantics will (mostly) apply to older versions of Python.
