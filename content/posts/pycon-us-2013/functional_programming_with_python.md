Title: 'Functional Programming with Python'
date: '2013-03-15'
---
Python supports several functional programming concepts. The presentations shows how to use functional features such as functions as first-class objects, closures, side-effect-fee functions, currying, lazy evaluation, no mutable data structures and use of iterators instead of loops. The focus is on integration of these concepts in existing programs.
