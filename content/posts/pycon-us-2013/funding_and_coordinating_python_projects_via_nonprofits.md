Organizations like Software Freedom Conservancy and PSF provide essential non-profit infrastructure to the Python community.  For the past few years, Conservancy specifically helped raise funds to support 3 key Python projects: Mercurial, PyPy and Twisted. This talk discusses successes and challenges of funding Python software development in non-profits, and discuss plans to expand this activity.
