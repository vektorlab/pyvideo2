Title: 'Analyzing Social Networks with Python'
date: '2013-03-13'

Social Network data is not just Twitter and Facebook - networks permeate our world - yet we often don't know what to do with them. In this tutorial, we will introduce both theory and practice of Social Network Analysis - gathering, analyzing and visualizing data using Python, NetworkX and PiCloud. We will walk the attendees through an entire project, from gathering data to presenting results.
