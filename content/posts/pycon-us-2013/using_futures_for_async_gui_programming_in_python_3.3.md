Title: 'Using futures for async GUI programming in Python 3.3'
date: '2013-03-15'
---
In Python 3.2 a new feature was added for concurrent programming - futures. In Python 3.3 generators have been extended to allow returning from a generator with a value. In this talk we'll show how these features can be combined to create a rich and easy to use asynchronous programming model which can be used for creating highly responsive GUI applications or easy async programming.
