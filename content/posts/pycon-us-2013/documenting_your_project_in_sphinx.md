Title: 'Documenting Your Project in Sphinx'
date: '2013-03-14'
---
Projects can succeed or fail because of their documentation. When you write, you need to concentrate on your proseâ€”not on how to get text rendered, indexed, highlighted, and cross-referenced. The Sphinx documentation framework exists to make these parts easy so you can focus on writing. This tutorial will use hands-on exercises to teach you to write, theme, and deploy documentation using Sphinx!
