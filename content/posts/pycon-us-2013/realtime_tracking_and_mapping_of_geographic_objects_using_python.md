Title: 'Realtime Tracking and Mapping of Geographic Objects using Python'
date: '2013-03-16'
---
Non-trivial mapping and location-centric applications are a beast of their own in terms indexing/querying/analyzing. Realtime tracking geo-applications add an even greater layer of complexity. 

In this talk we will give a short overview of the traditional OS web/mobile mapping architecture and datasets and extend it to include a realtime component.
