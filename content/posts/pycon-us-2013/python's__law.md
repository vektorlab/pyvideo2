Title: 'Python''s  Law'
date: '2013-03-16'
---
Open source software is changing intellectual property law. The talk would cover recent cases on what elements of software may be copied without infringing copyright,  the scope of software patents, enforceability of licenses, damages for copyright infringement, and how the network of community support for projects such as Python may be more potent in litigation than a patent portfolio.
