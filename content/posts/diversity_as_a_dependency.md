Title: '"Diversity as a Dependency"'
date: '2011-07-21'
---
The PSF recently adopted a diversity statement. While some argue that we
should do this just because it's "the right thing to do", others question why
we, as a technical community, should even worry about diversity. This talk
addresses the diversity question, not in moralistic or ethical terms, but in
pragmatic ones. Studies on creativity and productivity demonstrate the
potential benefits of diversity for the Python community. Making Python the
best language it can be is not merely helped by increasing diversity, but may
be dependent on diversity.
