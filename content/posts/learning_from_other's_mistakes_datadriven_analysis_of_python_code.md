Title: '"Learning from other''s mistakes: Data-driven analysis of Python code"'
date: '2015-04-11'
---
Static code analysis is an useful tool that can help to detect bugs early in the software development life cycle. I will explain the basics of static analysis and show the challenges we face when analyzing Python code. I will introduce a data-driven approach to code analysis that makes use of public code and example-based learning and show how it can be applied to analyzing Python code.
