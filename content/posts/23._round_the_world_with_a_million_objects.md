Python has provided a suite of tools required for our Lagrangian Particle
Modeling Framework that is used for simulation of atmospheric transport. The
Python language is used for generating input files for our FORTRAN codebase,
using f2py to control several aspects of running the model and reading output,
and dynamically generating content with matplotlib for web-display using
Plone.
