A summer in the wild

Presented by Alex Gaynor

I've spent this past summer away from Django, working for Quora, venturing
into the depths of a foreign codebase, and making it faster by running on
PyPy. This talk will feature the lessons I've learned about Django, PyPy, and
web development in general.
