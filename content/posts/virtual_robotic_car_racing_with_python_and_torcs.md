Title: '"Virtual robotic car racing with Python and TORCS"'
date: '2012-08-22'
---
A highly visual (racing videos) presentation showing the TORCS racing
simulator, a Python implementation of a virtual robot car, and a covering of
the basic AI algorithms required to make the wheels go round. AI, math, Python
and eye candy. What could possibly go wrong... what indeed.
