Mailman 3 has been in development for several years. This is an evolution of
the ever popular mailing list management system that runs thousands of mailing
lists around the world. This talk describes how the code has been modernized
and how the architectural deficiencies of Mailman 2 have been addressed using
REST and other technologies. This is a spinoff from the AOSA chapter on
Mailman 3.
