The talk targets developers who wish to publish applications to an
international audience and will discuss three topics that developers have to
deal with: handling Unicode, localizing the software with gettext and handling
time zones. First, the talk will address what Unicode is and how to write
applications that deal with Unicode correctly. Then, the talk will discuss
software localization using gettext and will conclude with a discussion of
time zone handling in Python. No prerequisites are necessary.
