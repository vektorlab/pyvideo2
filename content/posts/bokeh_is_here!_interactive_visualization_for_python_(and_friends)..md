date: '2015-05-29'
---
Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library for large datasets that natively uses the latest web technologies. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of Protovis/D3, while delivering high-performance interactivity over large data to thin clients. 
The talk will go through itâ€™s design providing details of the different API layers (bottom to top) concluding with a comprehensive showcase of examples to expose many of the features that make Bokeh so powerful and easy.
