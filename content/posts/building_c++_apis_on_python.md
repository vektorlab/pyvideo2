Title: '"Building C++ APIs on Python"'
date: '2012-07-05'
---
Python has great support for interfacing with C/C++ code, and this has been
used to great advantage by exposing many C/C++ libraries as Python modules. In
this talk, I will reverse the equation. I will show you how you can - and why
you might want to - build C++ APIs on top of Python modules and use them
directly from your C++ programs. The topics will include: Conversion of types
across the language boundary. Implementation of C++ idioms (e.g. the
begin()/end() iterator API) on top of Python idioms. Python runtime
management: initialization, module loading, etc. Working with the “impedance
mismatches” between the languages (e.g. duck-typing vs. static typing) I will
also discuss the reasons why C++ APIs on Python code represent a very useful
and often powerful technique. The reasons range from simple pragmatism (you
want to use an existing Python module in an existing C++ program) to
productivity (writing Python code plus a C++ wrapper can be easier and faster
than writing pure C++.) link - [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d
