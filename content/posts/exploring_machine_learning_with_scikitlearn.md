Title: '"Exploring Machine Learning with Scikit-learn"'
date: '2014-04-11'
---
This tutorial will offer an introduction to the core concepts of machine learning, and how they can be easily applied in Python using Scikit-learn. We will use the scikit-learn API to introduce and explore the basic categories of machine learning problems, related topics such as feature selection and model validation, and the application of these tools to real-world data sets.
