This training session will introduce the Python scientific stack to beginner
or intermediate-level Python programmers. The basics of scientific programming
with Python will be presented:

  * creation of arrays and structured arrays using numpy
  * fast, loopless manipulation of numpy arrays through fancy indexing and vectorized functions
  * convenient saving/loading of array variables using numpy
  * improved interactive use through ipython
  * data analysis using various scipy modules (signal analysis, image classification, etc)
  * plotting large time series, histograms, scatterplots, images etc. using matplotlib
  * saving/loading large datasets in structured scientific formats such as netCDF, HDF (depending on interest)

These concepts will be used in coding exercises, in the programming
environnement provided by the Python(x,y) distribution, which is freely
downloadable and includes recent versions of Python, numpy and matplotlib. The
Python(x,y) distribution runs on Windows, which will be the OS of choice for
this session. You should still be able to follow the examples in other Python
distributions, e.g. EPD.
