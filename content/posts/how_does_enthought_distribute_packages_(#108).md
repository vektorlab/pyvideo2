How does Enthought distribute packages?

  
Presented by Dr. Ilan Schnell

  
This presentation gives an overview of how packages are build and distributed
for different operating systems in the Enthought Python Distribution.
Enstaller (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Enstaller/4.0.0) is a tool I wrote for
installing egg-based packages, which are not necessarily Python packages, such
as SWIG or HDF5. I will discuss the architecture of Enstaller, and in
particular the egg-based distribution format.
