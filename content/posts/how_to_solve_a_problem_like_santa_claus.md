Title: '"How to Solve a Problem Like Santa Claus"'
date: '2012-11-11'

The Santa Claus Problem is a conceptually simple but notoriously tough
concurrency problem. For 20 years, the problem has been used to highlight new
concurrency features. Polyphonic C# sports an elegant solution using join
patterns. I prototyped a version of join patterns for Stackless Python. Rather
than hack Stackless Python's C code base, I use PyPy's stackless.py module and
greenlets!
