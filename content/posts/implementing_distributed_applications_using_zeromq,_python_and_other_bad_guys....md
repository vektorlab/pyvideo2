Title: 'Implementing distributed applications using ZeroMQ, Python and other bad
  guys...'
date: '2011-07-13'
---
Cloud Computing and Large Scale environments require sometime applications
based on complex and distributed architecturesâ€¦ and this usually means a huge
overhead in the design and confusion out of control in the code (network wise
race conditions, single points of failure and so on)

Introducing elements like *MQ and IPC frameworks in this kind of applications
is the only way to reduce the complexity and enable a fluid design (in other
words: mess-under-control)

The talk is focused on describing how to design a distributed application in
different scenarios, using ZeroMQ (a modern broker-less MQ system) as core
framework, with examples and demos.
