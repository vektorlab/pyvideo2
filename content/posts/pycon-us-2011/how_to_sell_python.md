Abstract

A lot of people want to use Python, but their customer, management, school,
government, or organization won't let them. Python is a great tool, but it can
be challenging to get in the door. This panel will explore how companies and
individuals have successfully introduced Python, what tools are available to
sell Python, and what pitfalls there are to avoid.

Possible questions will include:

  * What is a good example success story you can share? 
  * What pitfalls should you avoid? 
  * How do you deal with organizations that have already spent bucketloads of money on a piss-poor technology stack, are hurting for it, but can't seem to let go? 
  * How do you fight Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt (FUD) spread by people who stand to lose from introducing Python? 
  * What tools are available to help sell Python? 

Five panelists will be chosen from a broad spectrum of individuals including
academic, government, for-profit organizations, and non-profit organizations.

Speakers:

  * Academia: C. Titus Brown 
  * Goverment: Chris Shenton of Koansys/NASA 
  * Large Commercial Organization: Dan Mesh of Evite 
  * Small Commercial Organization: Frank Wiles of RevSys 
  * Non-Profit Organization: Rich Leland of National Geographic
