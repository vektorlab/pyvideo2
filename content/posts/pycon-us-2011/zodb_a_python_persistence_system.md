ZODB: A Python Persistence System

Presented by Chris McDonough

[ZODB](http://zodb.org/) is a transactional persistence system written
entirely in Python. This talk will serve as an introduction to using the ZODB
in a Python application.

Abstract

This talk will provide a high-level overview of ZODB useful to a novice or
intermediate Python programmer. The talk will cover the following topics:

  * What Is ZODB? 
  * Brief history 
  * ZODB vs. relational databases 
  * ZODB vs. NoSQL databases 
  * ZODB vs. pickle 
  * Using ZODB 
  * Creating a Persistent Object 
  * Storing a Persistent Object 
  * Retrieving a Persistent Object 
  * Modifying a Persistent Object 
  * Saving Changes 
  * Folders 
  * Aspects 
  * Pluggable storages 
  * Scaling across multiple clients 
  * Caching 
  * Indexing and Searching 
  * repoze.catalog 

At the end of the talk, an attendee should have a basic understanding of how
to create an application which depends on ZODB persistence.
