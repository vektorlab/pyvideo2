Title: 'Using Blender''s new BPY Python API'
date: '2011-03-11'
---
Since 2.5, the API has become more pythonic and self-descriptive. Blender's UI
can show you the Python equivalent for nearly every user action and includes a
full datablock exploration tool. Users will be taught how to use so they can
quickly adapt to their appropriate needs with a little Blender experience and
no previous BPY experience.

There will be a brief Blender overview, an introduction to the API and how to
use it, as well as / along with an overview of some of the presenter's own
tools / use cases. Some other popular 3rd party Python tools will also be
shown as an example.

If there is time, a brief demo of the Blender Game Engine will also be given,
though that is a separate API.
