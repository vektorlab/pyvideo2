How to write obfuscated python

Presented by Rev. Johnny Healey

With its clean, highly readable syntax, Python would seem to be quite a
challenge for a programmer attempting to write obfuscated code. Fortunately,
it provides a wide variety of high-level abstractions that can be misused in
exciting ways. This survey of obfuscation strategies will include topics such
as decorator abuse, lambda calculus, and bytecode manipulation.

Abstract

Python's clean syntax can make traditional approaches to writing obfuscated
code much more challenging. Fortunately, Python provides many useful
abstractions that can be misused to write code that is unreadable or even
deliberately misleading. This talk will provide a survey of silly python
tricks that explore the boundaries of the language.

Topics

  * Redefining builtins 
  * Rarely used syntax 
  * Comparison edge cases 
  * Things you probably shouldn't do with decorators 
  * Fun with lambdas 
  * Bytecode manipulation
