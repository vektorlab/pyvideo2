Pluggable Django Patterns

Presented by Corey Oordt

Pluggable or reusable applications are a key feature of Django, but there is
little guidance on writing them well. We'll dig into the different types of
Django applications and coding patterns that make writing a reusable
application easier. The talk also covers ways to avoid common implementation
gotchas.

Abstract

Reusable, or pluggable, applications are a powerful feature of Django. Your
code can do more if written with a few ideas and techniques in mind. We'll
cover:

  * The four qualities of a pluggable application 
  * The three types of Django applications 
  * Ten common situations in implementing reusable code and coding patterns to handle them
