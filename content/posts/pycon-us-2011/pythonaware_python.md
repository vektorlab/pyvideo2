Python-Aware Python

Presented by Ned Batchelder

Python provides many features for introspecting, analyzing, parsing,
compiling, and otherwise grokking Python code. This talk will cover a number
of the techniques for writing Python-Aware Python, and will hopefully inspire
you to build the next great Python tool.

Abstract

Python provides many features for introspecting, analyzing, parsing,
compiling, and otherwise grokking Python code. These modules and techniques
provide the foundation for developer's tools such as autocompletion IDE's,
code analysis tools, test runners, profilers, and so on.

I'll delve into a number of the common techniques used to write Python-Aware
Python. Each has its area of applicability and its strengths and weaknesses.
I'll demonstrate small samples that show how those techniques underlie the
tools we all know and love.

The world of Python tools is ready for new exploration. This talk will give
you the foundation you need to write the next great Python-aware application.
