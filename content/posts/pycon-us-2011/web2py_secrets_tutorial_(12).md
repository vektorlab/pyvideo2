web2py secrets

Presented by Massimo Di Pierro

We will provide an introduction to web2py with particular focus on its design
objectives, its differences when compared to other web frameworks, and some of
the most recently added features (components, plugins, openid/oauth
integration).

Abstract

Web2py is a framework for rapid web application development of secure
database-driven web applications. In this tutorial we will provide a brief
introduction to web2py, the web based IDE, its internal design, and its
internal file organization. We will explain the motivations behind some of its
most controversial design goals. We will also discuss in some detail its Ajax
capabilities by using web2py components and plugins for modular design of rich
web interfaces.

This will be a very concentrated version (10%) of a course (CSC438) on web
frameworks the author teaches at DePaul University. The course has been taught
3 times and the last time counted more than 30 students.
