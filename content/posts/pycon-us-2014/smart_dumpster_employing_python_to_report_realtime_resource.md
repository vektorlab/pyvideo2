Title: 'Smart Dumpster: Employing Python to Report Real-Time Resource'
date: '2014-04-13'
---
As U. of California campuses must reach Zero-Waste by 2020, a Smart Dumpster was designed to increase efficiency, study waste patterns, and improve refuse reduction. Using Python, a prototype has been installed into operations with tentative success since July 2013. Demonstrating real-time data reporting, the talk will focus on the success, roadblocks and campus plans for the Smart Dumpster.
