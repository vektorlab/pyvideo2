Title: 'Distributed task processing using Celery'
date: '2014-04-12'
---
Celery is a distributed task queue for Python that is used by a large number of web applications to off load tasks that can be executed asynchronously. This workshop will demonstrate how we can use Celery for a use case that isn't a web site or a web application and is something which could happen in a hospital or a bank or any other such large organization.
