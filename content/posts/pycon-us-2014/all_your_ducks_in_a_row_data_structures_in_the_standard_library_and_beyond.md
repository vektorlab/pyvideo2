Title: 'All Your Ducks In A Row: Data Structures in the Standard Library and Beyond'
date: '2014-04-12'
---
Why are Python programmers crazy about lists and dictionaries, when other languages tout bitmaps, linked lists, and B+ trees? Are we missing out? Come learn how data structures are implemented on bare metal, how to select the right data structure, how the list and dictionary cover a wide swath of use cases, and when to dip into the Standard Library or a
 third-party package for an alternative.
