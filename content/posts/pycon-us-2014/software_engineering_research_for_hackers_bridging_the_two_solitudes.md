Title: 'Software Engineering Research for Hackers: Bridging the Two Solitudes'
date: '2014-04-13'
---
Software engineering researchers and hackers don't talk to each other as much as they ought to. This talk aims to bridge that gap, teach practitioners about what research is out there, and spark a "citizen science" movement in software engineering. I'll explain how to study your own projects and get academics to pay attention. Together, we can learn how to develop better software.
