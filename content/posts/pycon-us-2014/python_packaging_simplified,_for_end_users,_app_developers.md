Title: 'Python packaging simplified, for end users, app developers'
date: '2014-04-13'
---
This talk covers the practical use of Python packaging tools. You'll see how to keep your system clean as an end user excited about installing a Python module from the web, the purpose of setup.py, how virtualenv makes life easier (and sometimes harder), what Ubuntu/Debian tools can offer, and how to make a complex app easier for new contributors to run. It is heavy on stories and recommendations.
