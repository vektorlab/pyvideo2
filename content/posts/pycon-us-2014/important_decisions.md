Title: 'Import-ant Decisions'
date: '2014-04-12'

Suppose `import` didn't exist, and we had to invent it from scratch. We'll look at the problem - code sharing and reuse across modules - and different ways we could solve it. We'll come up with `import` from parallel universes and then reinvent python's actual implementation. Finally, we'll import - using python's design - without using the `import` keyword.
