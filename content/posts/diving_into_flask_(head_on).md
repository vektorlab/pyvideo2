About the talk What is Flask? Is it any better than Django? Can I use Flask on
Google AppEngine? Fortunately, during the course of this talk I will not have
to answer any of these questions. This talk is a showcase of our experience
with using Flask to build flexible and scalable web service and it focuses
strongly on Flask and Flask extensions’ internals. Who should come to this
talk Basically anybody who’s looking to invest into learning Flask or already
started using Flask. Even though this talk focuses strongly on Flask-related
topics, it also raises important points relevant to any web development
framework or library. Abstract Introduction What we’re building Why we chose
Flask Flask RESTful APIs and Flask.route() Scaling Exploring Flask-Celery
Monitoring Celery logging: Oh, my! Scaling Celery Flask-SQLAlchemy Migrations
Sharding and master/slave setup Celery and SQLAlchemy: unexpected issues
Performance analysis Using werkzeug’s profiler Integrating with statsd
Investigating cache usage patterns Summary
