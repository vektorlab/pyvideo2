It seems like most people in the Django community either don't have any idea
how class-based views work or are scared to try them out. I want to help with
a solid introduction to the technology.

  * The usual "who I am" bit.
  * Most other things in Django are classes.
  *     * models
  *     * forms
  *     * even templates
  * Views should be classes, too.
  * What view classes are provided by Django.
  * How to create your own mixins to clean up pain points
  * Where function-based views are still handy.
  * Example CBVs for common use cases
  *     * handling form input for more than one form
  *     * serving different content based on users
