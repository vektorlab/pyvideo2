If you're a developer of any sort (Django, Python, Javascript, etc), chances
are that someone, at some point, will have to take the code you've written &
use it in a different context. This is even more amplified if you work on OSS,
where people _will_ use it in ways you've never dreamed about.

This talk is a reflection on my experience building libraries for other
people's consumption & thoughts on how to design/make (non-HTTP) APIs in a way
that will make others love you (or at least not hunt you down & strangle you).
