Introductory programming with Python

Presented by Brendan McCane

Abstract

In first semester 2009, CS at Otago introduced an introductory programming
course using Python. This talk will describe the course and student outcomes.

Outline

The talk will cover the following topics: - the problems of teaching and
learning programming - does language make a difference? - why Python is a good
choice for a first language - the structure of the course - things that worked
well, and things that didn't - what students thought about it - impact on
learning Java in the second semester - changes for 2010 Note: this is a
preliminary outline, it's likely that it will change somewhat before the
conference.
