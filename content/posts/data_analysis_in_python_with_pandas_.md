Title: '"Data analysis in Python with pandas "'
date: '2012-03-07'
---
The tutorial will give a hands-on introduction to manipulating and analyzing
large and small structured data sets in Python using the pandas library. While
the focus will be on learning the nuts and bolts of the library's features, I
also aim to demonstrate a different way of thinking regarding structuring data
in memory for manipulation and analysis.
