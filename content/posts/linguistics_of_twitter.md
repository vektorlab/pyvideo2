Contrary to expectations, the prevalence of television did not cause every
American to speak in a common standard dialect. Rather, smaller sub-regional
dialects are merging into stronger regional dialects with the largest change
in spoken English since the 1750's taking place in the Northern Cities Vowel
Shift.

Social Media is widely considered a conversational media, users often leaning
on their dialect which to express themselves.

Taking a recent tweet for example:

    
    '_andBeautyKills: – after tonight, don’t leave your boy roun’ me, umma #true playa fareal.'

This tweet presents a problem for traditional natural language processing
paradigm:

  * Do they build out an extensive reg ex to solve this? 
  * Even Worse, do they reject it because of non-Standard English? 
  * How do they respond such that communication is effective? 

Currently under development with Python using the Natural Language Toolkit are
the tools and methodologies to process, understand and respond to
communication that falls outside Standard American English. This talk will
focus on the status of existing tools, where development stands, challenges
for traditional tools and potential opportunities for exploration.

While limited to American English, any participant who is studying natural
language processing of any language is welcome and sure to learn. The
techniques could be applied to languages around the world for which the
motivated programmer is knowledgeable about.
