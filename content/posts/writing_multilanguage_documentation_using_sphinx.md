Internationalized documentation is a fairly new topic. And there are different approaches to do this. I will talk about how Sphinx internationalization support works, which tools and services I use and how to organize the translation workflow in an Open Source project. Finally I will have a look at what the future of internationalization in Sphinx might bring.
