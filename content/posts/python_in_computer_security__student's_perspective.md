As students of computer security, we are often the subject of academic discussion regarding the best topics to study. We hope to show how we have utilized python to within our area of study and why it is important for future students. Our goal is to encourage future classes of students to enjoy scripting. We will introduce how we as security students utilize Python as an everyday tool with specific examples of how we used Python in various security competitions and gave us a noticeable advantage over other teams.  This will include scripts used as defenders against various red team attacks
