With the growth of the web, how we publish is changing. Paper alone is not
enough, web pages are also required. And for many web pages it is not enough
to rely on the browser’s print capabilities. Sphinx, used since 2008 for
Python’s documentation, is a creative response to this tension.

This talk will take a broader view of the problem. For example, many browsers
support web fonts for display but not for printing. Mathematics on web pages
is still difficult, but SVG holds out much promise not only for mathematics
but for tables and other complex typeset material. Achieving accessibility
remains difficult.

Based on over 15 year’s experience in print and electronic publishing, this
talk will survey problems and emerging solutions. Software and sites covered
include LaTeX, PDF, SVG, MathJax, web-fonts, PediaPress, Sphinx and arXiv.
