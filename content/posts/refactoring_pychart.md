Title: 'Refactoring PyChart'
date: '2011-07-13'
---
PyChart is a very nice program for producing print quality graphs. However, it
came equipped with a rather strange API, where every class was called T. It
was also using the global namespace in strange and disturbing ways.
Furthermore, it mixed multiple distinct tasks in some classes.

I will show how I went about refactoring the package in order to make a nice
and clean API. This talk is focused on teaching refactoring methodology to
beginner and intermediate level programmers. It will also give a brief
introduction to how to make beautiful graphs with PyChart.
