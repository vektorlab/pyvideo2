Disqus: Serving 400 million people with Python

Presented by David Cramer and Jason Yan

Disqus, one of the largest Python applications on the web, will explain how
they deal with scaling complexities in a growing startup. Founded in 2007,
Disqus maintains a small engineering team reaching over 400 million users a
month. Being powered by Python has allowed quick iteration of the application,
without sacrificing code quality and performance. The talk will cover key
parts of the architecture and development process at Disqus, including
hardware, databases, and common bottlenecks.
