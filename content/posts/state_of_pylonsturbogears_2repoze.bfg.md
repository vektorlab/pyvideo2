State of Pylons/TurboGears 2/repoze.bfg

Presented by Chris McDonough, Ben Bangert, and Mark Ramm

A three-for-one talk by the main developers of three popular Python web
frameworks! We'll (very) briefly cover the state of each of our individual
frameworks and communities, and then we'll describe the results of our efforts
to work together and share code.

Abstract

Pylons is a popular, lightweight Python web framework.

TurboGears 2 is a full-stack framework built atop Pylons.

repoze.bfg is a moderately popular, lightweight Python web framework.

The main developers and community leaders of these frameworks have been
working together and sharing as much as possible over the course of roughly
the last year. We'll very briefly describe to the audience the states of our
individual efforts, then we'll discuss how we intend to move forward and share
more code and effort in the year to come. The talk will be more socially-
oriented than technical.

It's unusual for open source code and communities to bridge minor perceived
differences in scope and style and to start sharing code and ideas openly. If
you're a user of any of these frameworks, you'll want to be present for this
talk.
