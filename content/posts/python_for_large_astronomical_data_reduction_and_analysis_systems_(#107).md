Python for Large Astronomical Data Reduction and Analysis Systems

Presented by Francesco Pierfederici (Harvard-Smithsonian Center for

We describe how Python is used in a large astronomy project to automatically
process data from several telescopes in both the hemispheres. We introduce the
general problem and discuss challenges and lessons learned.
