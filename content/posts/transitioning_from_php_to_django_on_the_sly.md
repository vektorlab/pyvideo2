Title: 'Transitioning from PHP to Django on the sly'
date: '2013-07-06'
---
You know that Python and Django is the way forward for your client, but with a mountain of legacy PHP code, where do you start?

Ben spent the last 3 years working with a thriving charity organisation to migrate their large PHP system to Django. He'd like to share some survival strategies.

This talk covers:

 - explaining the transition to your client
 - first steps and initial experiments
 - running PHP and Django in parallel
 - why incremental migration beats the "big switch"
 - sharing databases and authentication
 - making the experience seamless for visitors and staff
 - strategies for converting the code
