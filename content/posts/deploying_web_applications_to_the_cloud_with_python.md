Title: '"Deploying web applications to the cloud with Python"'
date: '2011-07-13'

How can Python help you deploy web applications to the cloud? Amazon EC2
provides virtual machines on demand but as a developer you still have to
configure these machines and push your code to them. Fabric is a Python
library that lets you execute commands on a remote machine, and Boto is a
Python library for interfacing with Amazon web services. By using Fabric and
Boto, you can easily create repeatable deployments and provision new resources
as needed with minimal effort.

This talk will introduce Amazon Web Services and how to launch new machines
using simple Boto scripts, and how to get started making your own repeatable
deployments using Fabric scripts.
