Title: 'pyDAL: a pure python Database Abstraction Layer'
date: '2015-05-29'
---
This talk will provide an overview and quick demonstration of the features and the APIs of pyDAL, the python Database Abstraction Layer.  It dynamically generates the SQL in real time using the specified dialect for the database back end, so that you do not have to write SQL code or learn different SQL dialects (the term SQL is used generically), and your code will be portable among different types of databases.  pyDAL comes from the original web2py's DAL, with the aim of being wide-compatible. pyDAL doesn't require web2py and can be used in any Python context.
