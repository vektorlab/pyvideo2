Concurrent programming in Python may be hard. A lot of solutions exists
though. Most of them are based on an eventloop. This talk will present
what I discovered and tested along the time with code examples, from
asyncore to asyncio, passing by gevent, eventlet, twisted and some new
alternatives like evergreen or gruvi. It will also present my little
experiment in porting the Go concurrency model in Python named [offset](http://github.com/benoitc/offset),
how it progressed in 1 year and how it became a fully usable library .

This presentation will be an update of the presentation I gave at the FOSDEM 2014. It will introduce to the concurrency concepts and how they are implemented in the different libraries.
