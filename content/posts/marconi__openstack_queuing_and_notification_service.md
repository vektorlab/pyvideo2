Title: 'Marconi - OpenStack Queuing and Notification Service'
date: '2014-07-22'
---
Similar to other message bus frameworks, Marconi's main goals are: performance, availability, durability, fault-tolerance and scalability.
Besides providing support for queuing and notification services through OpenStack, Marconi aims to ease the design of distributed systems and allow for asynchronous work distribution without creating yet another message broker.
This talk aims to give the audience a broad look at Marconiâ€™s architecture, design, technologies used, development process, and discuss the issues it adresses.
