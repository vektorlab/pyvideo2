Title: 'Pitfalls of Continuous Deployment'

Practice iterative development like the pros. Release sooner, faster, and more
often.

Continuous deployment (and testing) has started to become a reality for many
companies. It brings to light one of the many problems that face large product
teams, but also creates some of its own. This talk will focus on the pros and
cons of continuous deployment, how DISQUS switched from the recurring release
cycle to continuous releases, as well as providing tips and arguments for
adopting it in your workplace.
