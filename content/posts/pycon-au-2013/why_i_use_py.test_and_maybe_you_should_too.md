Have you tried unit testing? Always meant to add tests to your project but didn't know where to start? This presentation will provide a gentle introduction to unit testing your module, package or entire project.

The standard library comes with the unit test module but a great alternative is py.test. Py.test makes starting to test your project as easy as possible. When you need them it has a full set of tools and testing capabilities. 

This presentation will provide an overview of unit testing and then show how easy it is to get started using py.test.
