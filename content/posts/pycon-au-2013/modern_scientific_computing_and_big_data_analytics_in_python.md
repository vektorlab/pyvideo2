This is a tutorial on using the latest and most exciting tools in Python for scientific and engineering applications in 2013, with a focus on 'big data' applications. Using real-world data sets and a fully Python 3 environment, it will walk you through what's possible with modern tools like the machine-learning package scikit-learn, the image-processing package scikit-image, the Pandas toolkit for data analysis, and IPython-parallel. It will also review the upcoming generation of tools like Numba and Blaze.
