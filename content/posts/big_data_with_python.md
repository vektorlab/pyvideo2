Dealing with big data isn't a particularly new problem. There are all sorts of
new solutions, each with their own niche, their own hype. It's important to
remember that python is not "too slow" for big data, and that with projects
such as scipy, numpy, cython and rpy, python is becoming a better tool then
ever for data processing. In this talk we'll be explaining some of the theory
behind big data problems, where python fits in and some of the more
interesting things you can do.
