Title: '"The Journey to Give Every Scientist a Supercomputer"'
date: '2012-03-10'
---
The recent cloud buzz has hugely benefited Python web devs. But, for Python's
formidable scientific community, the cloud has been less ambitious--until now.
PiCloud is a Python-based cloud platform that tackles a noble cause: giving
every scientist in the world instant access to a supercomputer. The talk will
cover how Python inspired the design of PiCloud, which has now processed over
100M jobs.
