Advanced String Formatting

  
Eric Smith (True Blade Systems, Inc.)

  
Advanced string formatting (str.format, described in PEP 3101) was added in
Python 2.6 and 3.0 as a more powerful, flexible, and extensible alternative to
the existing %-based string formatting.

  
This talk will discuss how to use str.format, how your own types can benefit
from it, its strengths and weaknesses, how to migrate to it, and advanced
topics such as implementing your own templating language.
