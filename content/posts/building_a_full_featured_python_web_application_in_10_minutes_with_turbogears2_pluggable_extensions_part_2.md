Title: '"Building a full featured Python Web Application in 10 minutes with turbogears2
  pluggable extensions part 2"'
date: '2012-07-06'

The TurboGears 2.1 release series has deeply focused on speeding up the
development process for rapidly prototyping full featured applications. This
has lead to a many improvements to the CRUD extension and to the support to
pluggable applications. Mastering those tools can make possible to build a
complete application without much effort using the partials made available by
the pluggable applications and exposing administrative interfaces in a bunch
of lines of code using the CRUD extension both using SQLA and MongoDB.
