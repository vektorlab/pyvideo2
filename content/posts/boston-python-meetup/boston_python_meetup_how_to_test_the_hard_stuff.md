How to Test the Hard Stuff

Presented by Stephan Richter

Stephan will cover testing network-driven components, RDB stubbing, test setup
layering and stuff like that. Recently he used manuel to do this sort of
testing by simulating CLIs and Shell access in a doctest-style test, so he may
cover that as well.

Bring your testing challenges and the impossible to automate projects that
haunt you at night, we'll see what Stephan can do with them.
