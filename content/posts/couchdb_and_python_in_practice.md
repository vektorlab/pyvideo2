CouchDB and Python in practice

Presented by Luke Gotszling

This talk introduces one 'NoSQL' solution, CouchDB, and how to get it to play
well with Python. Topics covered:

  * Introduction to CouchDB 
  * A python ORM for CouchDB 
  * Parsing CouchDB documents within python 
  * Writing view functions in python 
  * Map/reduce on CouchDB from python 
  * Lessons learned from managing and distributing a live deployment at scale under high load 

Abstract

This is a rough draft

NoSQL

  * CouchDB stores schema free documents 

Why CouchDB?

  * Complicated mapping structures handled 
  * Revision history 
  * Maps nicely to Python objects 
  * HTTP protocol 

Python ORM

  * couchdb-python 
  * Mapping structures 
  * demo 

View functions

  * write in Erlang, Javascript, Python? 
  * demo 

Scaling

  * Distributed map/reduce 
  * BigCouch 
  * Read/write quorum
