Title: 'Django+Elasticsearch+Haystack to Search PDFs and Such'
date: '2015-02-12'

Have you ever wanted to search the contents of uploaded PDFs, Docs, and other document formats on your website?  Django Haystack (with the Elasticsearch search backend) is a great way to add search to your site, but it does not support full document indexing out of the box.  I'd like to share a solution that I cobbled together to allow this combination of tools the ability to search document contents.
