What you think Love is - is (probably) wrong.

The correct metaphor / definition for live will make much more sense to the software person.  In fact, it will help with team building and design too.  Yup.

Grab a beer.   I'll tell you a story about how this evolved (turing machine example), how and where evolution selected it, and why it works - and how it works for approaching problems (design) too.

Then I'll lay out the api (functional description).

Cheers!
