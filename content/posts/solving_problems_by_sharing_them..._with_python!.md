By using a variety of techniques and technologies, you can tap into the expert knowledge of others more effectively. Revision control and code reviews are great for software quality, but not everyone is going to work that way. Tools such as ipython notebook, sharing gists, demonstration sessions and screencasts are a great way to get others involved in problem solving. Knowing how to use these tools quickly and effectively can also be a great way to explain problems to management, or to walk them through a complex requirement.
