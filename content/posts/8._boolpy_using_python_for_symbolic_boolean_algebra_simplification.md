BoolPy is a Python module that iteratively simplifies Boolean Algebra
expressions according to the Boolean Theorems. The purpose of this talk is
twofold: (1) To present the details of an Object-Oriented solution to the
symbolic computing problem and (2) to present the BoolPy module as a useful
classroom tool for teaching Boolean Algebra in college-level mathematics and
computer science courses.
