Genropy - A framework for creating complex applications deployed on the web

Presented by Jeff B Edwards (Goodsoftware)

[Genropy](http://blog.genropy.org/) is the python implementation of Genro, and
is an application framework quite different from the standard (django,
cherrypy, turbogears), for building powerful database applications deployed
from the browser. Many differences and advantages between this framework and
traditional python application frameworks are explained. Genropy is a suitable
for creating complex 'applications' as opposed to 'sites'. The differentiation
is that an application is something an operator uses all day, has trained
users, that have to 'squeeze' all the power from it available. Conversely, a
'site' is basically public and not necessarily powerful as a user spends a
relatively small amount of time on it. Genropy is the framework for creation
applications. It is used for attendee registration and sales in pycon italy,
the larger national conference in Europe (Florence, Italy).

This session will demonstrate how to create a simple application (3 tables)
and demonstrate the ease and power of using python for the model view and
controller on the client. It demonstrates how one api- being the genro Bag -
is used to create the model, to map the sql to objects, to create the GUI and
communicate all data. So all of it can be done in python instead of having to
use many different technologies and languages.

Jeff Edwards from Goodsoftware is strategic partner of Sofwell who is the
author of Genropy.
