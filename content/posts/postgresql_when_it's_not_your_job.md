It's a very rare startup these days that has a full-time DBA on staff; mostly,
the developers are pressed into service to handle the database as well. In
this talk, we'll present the survival skills required to manage your
PostgreSQL database while trying to push the product out the door.

We'll cover:

  * Installation.
  * Basic tuning (it's easier than you think).
  * Performance, including things you must not do.
  * Backups and disaster recovery.
  * Helpful tools, tips and tricks.

Django experience is helpful, but no PostgreSQL experience required.
