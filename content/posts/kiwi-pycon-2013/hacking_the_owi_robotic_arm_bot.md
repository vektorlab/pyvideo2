@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 1

**Audience level**

Novice

**Abstract**

After buying my son an OWI robotic arm,we decided to see if we could do more with it than use the remote controller. We quickly found you can buy a USB interface, however it only came with windows drivers. After some googling we found we could control this with python scripts which led to even more fun!
