@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 2

**Audience level**

Intermediate

**Abstract**

Something about OpenStack - sorry it's brief, I will flesh it out more tomorrow, wanted to meet your deadline... and I'm happy to change the talk to meet your interests - I'm still relatively new in the OpenStack community, but driving a fascinating operations project (which isn't really PyCon material, sadly) - but which gets me in contact with most of the 'stackers projects. : More tomorrow ;)
