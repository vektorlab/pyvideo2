Title: 'Polyominoes - An Exploration in Problem Solving with Python'
date: '2013-09-12'
---
@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 2

**Audience level**

Intermediate

**Abstract**

A "Polyomino" is a geometric figure of adjacent squares. But just how many "n" polyominos are there?

This question has been one of our favourite interview questions. It's a deceptively simple problem with opportunities for innovative solutions and disastrous missteps. In this talk, we'll discuss the benefits of a number of approaches, demonstrate a few common pitfalls and challenge the audience to provide their own solutions, with prizes on offer at the end of the conference.

This is a talk for everyone: beginners will be introduced to a problem that can be solved using primitives, experts will see opportunities to deploy advanced optimizations.
