@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Sunday, 08 Sep 2013 - Track 2

**Audience level**

Intermediate

**Abstract**

Python tools are used for publishing a large corpus of theological literature. Python is used to help convert the existing literature from its original, poorly styled, MS Word format to docutils source format. Solutions are presented to various domain-specific problems, including making the documents bible-version independent. The paver tool is used to manage the conversion process from docutils to the various output formats. Some rejected alternative publishing technologies are covered, as well as a future road map.
