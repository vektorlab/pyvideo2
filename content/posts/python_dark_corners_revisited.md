Python can be deceptive - it looks so simple. Surely it will take only 5 to 10
minutes to learn.

Self taught programmers often miss important fundamentals in Python -
including:

  * Everything is an Object. Yes everything. Integers, 'real' objects, functions, classes. Ooooh template metaprogramming.
  * It's only a name. Whoops. True, False, no longer None.
  * 'Objects can change their type'. Not.
  * How the heck to a actually make a copy
  * Which parts of tuples are constant?
  * Deep and Shallow - weren't not talking philosophy here
  * Accidental name creation - there's no easy solution
  * Argument passing, Mutable arguments, default arguments, Mutable default arguments
  * Questions
