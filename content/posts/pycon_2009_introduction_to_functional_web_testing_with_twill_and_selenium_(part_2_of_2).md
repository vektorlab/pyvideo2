[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ] This tutorial aims to educate attendees on the the basics
of functional testing of web applications. Is your app rendered as plain HTML?
Great! We'll show you how to build a test suite for it. Is your app all AJAXy?
No problem! We can do that too! We're going to write a web application, first
in straight html and then with AJAX, and show you how to try to break it. At
the end of this hands-on session, you'll be able to write tests for almost any
web site, using all open-source tools and our favorite language - Python.
