Title: '"Challenges in developing a large Django site"'
date: '2011-07-18'
---
Django makes it easy to build web sites and applications on tight deadlines -
but how does it deal with sites that scale up in both traffic and complexity?
Using Lanyrd.com as a case study, this talk will explore tricks and techniques
for taking advantage of what Django has to offer while coping with the
unexpected challenges raised by a highly dynamic social web application.

Topics covered will include performance monitoring and optimisation, advanced
caching tricks, denormalisation with Solr and Redis and finding the right
balance between technical elegance and pragmatism.
