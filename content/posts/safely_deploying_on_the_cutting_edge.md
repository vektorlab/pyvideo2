Safely deploying on the cutting edge

Eric Holscher

This talk will go through the deployment system that we have built at Urban
Airship. It will cover the process that allows us to automate our deployments,
making it safe to deploy at any time. It's built on Fabric, Gunicorn,
Virtualenv, Rsync, Supervisord, and Python. We end up with fully isolated
environments for our services that are easy to manage.
