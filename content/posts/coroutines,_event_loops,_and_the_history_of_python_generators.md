Title: '"Coroutines, event loops, and the history of Python generators"'
date: '2012-03-10'

This talk traces lightweight concurrency from Python 2.2's generators, which
enabled semi-coroutines as a mechanism for scheduling "weightless" threads; to
PEP 342, which created true coroutines, and hence made event-driven
programming easier; to 3rd party libraries built around coroutines, from older
GTasklet and peak.events to the current Greenlet/gevent and Twisted Reactor.
