This talk will show introduce pytest and show some unique and innovative features. It will show how to get started using it and some of the most important features.

One of these features is the ability to write tests in a more “pythonic” way by using the assert statement for assertions. Another feature in pytest is fixtures – a way to handle test dependencies in a structured way. This talk will introduce the concept of fixtures and show how they can be used.

No previous knowledge of pytest is required – this talk is for people who are new to testing or has experience with other Python testing tools such as unittest or Nose.
