**Graphs** define a powerful mental (and mathematical) model of structure, 
representing the building blocks of formulations and/or solutions 
for many *hard problems*. In this talk, graphs and (*some of the*) main 
graph-related algorithms will be analysed from a **very pythonic** angle:
the [Zen of Python][1] (e.g., *beautiful is better than ugly*, 
*simple is better than complex*, *readability counts*).
