A Little South Sanity

Presented by Brian Luft

South is a useful tool in agile development environments, but learning to use
it effectively can take some practice. In this demo-driven talk we'll walk
through some common workflow examples, dissect a couple pitfalls, and call out
the relative strengths and weaknesses of South as a tool at each step. Finding
South's sweet spot for your environment will give you the best results.
