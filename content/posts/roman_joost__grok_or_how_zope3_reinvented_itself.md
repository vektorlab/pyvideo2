Grok or how Zope3 reinvented itself

Presented by Roman Joost

Abstract

The talk introduces how to quickly and easily create web applications with
Grok, a web framework based on Zope3
([http://grok.zope.org/](http://grok.zope.org/)).

Outline

Grok is a web application framework based on Zope 3 - the popular application
server. One of the main aspects of Grok is the rapid development of web
applications without losing the flexibility Zope 3 provides. The talk covers a
quick introduction to Zope 3 and Grok. Based on an example, I will provide a
quick walk through on how easy it is to create sophisticated web applications
with Grok. Additionally, the talk outlines pitfalls for newcomers and how to
avoid them.
