This tutorial will offer an overview of common usage and methodological patterns when using Scikit-Learn to build predictive models. In particular we will highlight common strategies to deal with data with heterogeneously typed attributes with pandas dataframes, model evaluation and tuning. Finally if time permits we will explore the specificities of working with textual data.
