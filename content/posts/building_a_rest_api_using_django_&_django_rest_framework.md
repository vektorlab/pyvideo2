Title: '"Building a REST API Using Django & Django REST Framework"'
date: '2015-04-11'
---
Using a combination of Django and Django REST Framework, we will build a Restaurant Menu that can be managed via a REST API. Starting from the install of the Django REST Framework, we will build our way to a functional API that meets the needs of developers and end-users. You will walk away with an understanding of the basic concepts of REST APIs and a working sample project.
