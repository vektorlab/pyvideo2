Title: 'Document Classification with Machine Learning'
date: '2015-05-30'

The presentation will discuss how Python was used to implement a machine-learning algorithm that accepts a training set of documents and then classifies documents based on word vector similarity. This project inspired by faculty at DePaul is now a fully-fledged start-up.
