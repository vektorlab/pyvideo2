Title: 'Bringing Research to Real Life'

Machine learning is a fascinating field with numerous applications in data science. New research is always emerging in the field of machine learning but it can take years for this research to be converted into usable software libraries. In this talk, I'll be providing a technique for reading (actually reading) research papers and using the powerful syntax and data-focused libraries of Python to write up quick and dirty implementations of techniques written out in research papers. This talk is relevant to any practical professional who occasionally strays into the field of academics to discover new techniques that are applicable to the data problems that they are attempting to solve.
