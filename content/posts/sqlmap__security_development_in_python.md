Title: '"sqlmap - security development in Python"'
date: '2011-07-24'
---
The "sqlmap" is one of the largest, widely used and most active Python
projects in the IT security community (more than 2000 commits in one year
period with community of over 100 active testers). It combines it's
developers' strong security knowledge together with analytical, mathematical
and Python development skills to provide IT professionals with vibrant
features.

Talk would be consisted of several parts: short introduction to project and
developers, developing and testing environment, programming cycle, program's
workflow, technologies used, common pitfalls and how we've circumvent them,
usage of mathematical models, optimizations, project's future goals.

The significant part of this talk would be the immediate insight into the
developing process of probably the world's most advanced open-source Python IT
security project today.
