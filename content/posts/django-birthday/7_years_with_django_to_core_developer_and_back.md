Title: '7 Years With Django: To Core Developer and Back'
date: '2015-07-11'
---
One night, in September 2007, I read every page of Django's documentation and the entire (then draft) Django Book. Over the next few years I became a frequent contributor to Django, including becoming a core developer and later a member of the DSF board. Now I'm largely uninvolved with Django's development. This talk is the story of my time with Django. This talk is a walk through my time with Django -- from emailing Adrian to ask about attending a sprint that had already happened, to contributing patches, to the multi-db GSOC, to Eric Florenzano's keynote, becoming a core developer, joining the board, to slowly fading away and becoming an emeritus developer.
