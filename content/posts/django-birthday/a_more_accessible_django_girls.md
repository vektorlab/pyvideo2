Title: 'A More Accessible Django Girls'
date: '2015-07-11'
---
Appropriate planning and accommodations make Django Girls workshops and other tech events more open to many groups, including people with disabilities, Deaf attendees, attendees with mental illnesses, and more. You'll leave this talk with some concrete things you can do to make your next meetup, workshop, or conference more inclusive of people with disabilities, including how to advertise your accommodations, what to look for in a venue, and some free tools to help your website be more accessible.
