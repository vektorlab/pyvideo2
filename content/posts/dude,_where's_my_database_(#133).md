Dude, Where's My Database?

  
Presented by Eric Florenzano (Django)

  
There are so many great open source databases out on the market right now--
we're really in the golden age of databases. Fortunately, Python can talk to
virtually all of them. With so many databases at our disposal, how do we
choose which one to use for our particular use case?

  
This talk will go over the many different classes of databases, introduce some
of the particular implementations for each class of database, and describe the
strengths and weaknesses of each. By weighing the pros and cons of each type
of database, the speaker hopes to dispel the many rumors and misconceptions
that people have about what's out there today.
