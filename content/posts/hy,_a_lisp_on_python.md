Hy (https://github.com/hylang/hy) is an implementation of a Lisp language on top of Python. It The project has been started this year, and is making good progress, since a lot of code can already be executed. Compatibility with Python is one of its core attribute, and in this regard it follows the path that Clojure took with Java.
