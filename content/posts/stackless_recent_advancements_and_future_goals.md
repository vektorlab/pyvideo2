Stackless: Recent advancements and future goals
-------------------------------------------------------

Since Python release 1.5 Stackless Python is an enhanced variant of C-Python.
Stackless is best known for its addition of lightweight microthreads (tasklets) and 
channels.

Less known are the recent enhancements that became available with Stackless 2.7.6. 
In this talk core Stackless developers demonstrate

 * The improved multi-threading support
 * How to build custom scheduling primitives based on atomic tasklet operations
 * The much improved debugger support
 * ...
 
Stackless recently switched the new master repository from hg.python.org/stackless to bitbucket to 
allow for a more open development process. We'll summarise our experience and discuss our
plans for the future development of Stackless.

The talk will be help by Anselm Kruis and Christian Tismer.
If we are lucky, we will also welcome Kristján Valur Jónsson from Iceland.
