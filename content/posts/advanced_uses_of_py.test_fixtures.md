date: '2014-07-24'
---
This talks will assume some basic familiarity with the py.test
testing framework and explore only the fixture mechanism.  It will
build up more complex examples which will lead up to touching on
other plugin features of py.test.  It is expected people will be
familiar with python features like functions as first-class objects,
closures etc.
