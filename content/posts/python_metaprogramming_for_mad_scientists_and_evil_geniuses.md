This talk covers the power and metaprogramming features of Python that cater
to mad scientists and evil geniuses. This will also be of interest to others
who just want to use of Python in a more power (hungry) way. The core concept
is that you can synthesize functions, classes and modules without a direct
correspondence to source code. You can also mutate third-party objects and
apps.
