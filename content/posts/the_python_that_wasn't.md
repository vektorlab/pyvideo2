The Python That Wasn't

Presented by Larry Hastings

One reason for Python's success is its restraint in adding new language
features. Only the most essential changes make it--and for every change that
gets accepted, many more are rejected. Come learn about proposed changes to
the Python language that failed--what, how, and why.

Abstract

  * Quick overview of the process 
    * First ten years: send GvR a patch 
    * The modern approach: python-ideas, write a PEP, produce a reference implementation 
  * Discuss the "prickly" Python community 
    * This is a good thing! Only the best ideas survive the python-dev gauntlet! 
    * They do this not because they're mean, but because they care so much. 
    * We must have eternal vigilance to prevent unnecessary changes! 
  * A survey of some changes that didn't make it 
    * The switch/case statement (PEP 3103) 
    * The "freeze protocol" (PEP 351) 
    * The "dynamic attribute access" proposal from python-dev, 2007/02 
    * Many more possibilities await in the rejected PEPs! 
  * My message to the audience 
    * Start with a post to python-ideas, please! 
    * Don't be surprised if you get a negative reaction 
    * Don't let your fear of a negative reaction stop you from trying, necessarily 
    * Do your homework, and be your own worst critic
