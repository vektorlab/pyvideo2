In this talk I'm going to explain the main features and possibility that
Panda3D gives us when we want to create a game from scratch. Then, I'll
explain how the engine is structured and how it works conceptually going also
through code examples and some practical operations.

It's meant for beginners who have also never worked with realtime graphics and
the only prerequisite is a bit of python knoweledge including how to write a
simple program and how to run it. The goal is to create a simple realtime
application that take care of user input and reacts depending on it.
