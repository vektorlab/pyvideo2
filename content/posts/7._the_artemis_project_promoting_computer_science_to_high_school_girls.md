The Artemis Project is a summer program to introduce high school girls to the
problem-solving skills that are at the core of computer science. As
coordinators, we found that there is a lot of undiscovered talent and
enthusiasm for CS in the younger generation. Our poster is meant to encourage
discussions on intuitive ways to introduce programming and interesting
projects for novice programmers.
