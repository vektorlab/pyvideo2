The earlier a bug is discovered, the cheaper it is to fix it. Method
restrictions (such as abstract, final and @Override) help the programmer in
discovering incompatibilities between a class and its subclass early (i.e. at
startup time for Python and at compile time for compiled languages). Python
doesnâ€™t provide method restrictions out of the box. To implement them, we take
a deep dive to the realms of Python metaprogramming (decorators, metaclasses,
method wrappers, traceback inspection and builtins). Lots of short and code
examples will be provided to show the building blocks and how we combine them.
