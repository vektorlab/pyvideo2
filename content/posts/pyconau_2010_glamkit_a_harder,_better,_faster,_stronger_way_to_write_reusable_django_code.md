GLAMkit: a harder, better, faster, stronger way to write reusable Django code

Presented by Dr. Greg Turner (the Interaction Consortium)

As part of our web development work for Galleries, Libraries, Archives and
Museums (the so-called GLAM sector), we have open-sourced the common tools and
design patterns that we have developed as a web framework called GLAMkit
([http://glamkit.org/](http://glamkit.org/)).

GLAMkit is based on Django, and is inspired by its design philosophy of
several apps which implement specific features. However, by looking at the
successes and challenges faced by other CMSes and collections of apps such as
Pinax, we have taken the philosophy a stage futher.

Rather than being a collection of Django apps, we have constructed GLAMkit as
a collection of optional and reusable Django 'toolkits' for implementing
common features. We leave the implementation details - the things that Django
already does brilliantly - to the application developers themselves.

In this talk, we will present the history of GLAMkit's development, with
particular focus on how our approach to reusability came about, and some
examples of that approach.
