Title: 'An Introduction to Image Classification'
date: '2015-10-01'
---
In this tutorial, two main areas will be covered using Textural Images Dataset:
<ol>
<li>Textural Features Methods: (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM), Local Binary Pattern(LBP) and Local Directional Pattern(LDP))</li>
<li>Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes(NB).</li>
</ol>

Both Features Extraction and Classification will be implemented using Python.

Texture is a very important factor in computer vision; it represents the first level of spatial properties that can be extracted from digital image. Texture can be defined as relationship between gray level in neighboring pixels.
