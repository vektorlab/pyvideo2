The talk will be a introductory tutorial showing how to get an ANPR (Automated Number Plate Recognition) system, which was developed for community security, up and running on your Raspberry Pi. This will provide a comfortable starting point for any security-prone person to start monitoring the vehicles entering and leaving their community.
