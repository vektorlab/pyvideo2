Computational Geometry is the study of geometry with the support of
appropriate algorithms, and influences a broad range of fields of science,
engineering and mathematics including: Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD),
Finite Element Modelling (FEM), Computer Aided Design / Modelling (CAD/CAM),
Robotics, Computer Graphics and Collision Detection.

While it is possible to quickly implement naive versions of computational
geometry algorithms in any language, such algorithms can be expensive and time
consuming to write, debug and maintain. The advent of a number of tools,
including new bindings for the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
(CGAL) and the ipython notebook make Python an ideal tool for experimentation
with fast and numerically robust algorithms.

The presentation will include demonstrations of a number of common two- and
three-dimensional computational geometry algorithms:

  * Triangulations (and Voronoi diagrams)
  * Mesh refinement
  * Intersection testing
  * Alpha shapes
  * Convex hulls
  * Constructive Solid Geometry
  * Minkowski Sums
