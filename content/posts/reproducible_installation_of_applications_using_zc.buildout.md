Title: '"Reproducible installation of applications using zc.buildout"'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
zc.buildout is a tool to install and configure applications. An application
may consist of multiple parts and include multiple programs and processes.
Both installation and configuration of the application as a whole are
controlled by a configuration file which makes it possible to reproduce them
exactly at a later point in time or on a different host. zc.buildout is
extensible so it may be used to install application parts with nearly
arbitrary individual requirements. The talk introduces zc.buildout, gives an
overview of its possibilities as well as the major third-party extensions and
demonstrates the system by means of a case study.
