Title: '"More than just a pretty web framework, the Tornado IOLoop"'
date: '2012-03-11'
---
Tornado, often thought of as a web development framework and toolset is built
on top of a protocol-agnostic IOLoop, presenting an alternative to Twisted as
a foundation for asynchronous application development in Python. This talk
covers the Tornado IOLoop, its features and the process of writing drivers and
applications using it.
