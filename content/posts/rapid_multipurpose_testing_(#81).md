Rapid multi-purpose testing

Presented by Holger Krekel

Want to rapidly test code, javascript or documents on different Python
Interpreters and versions? This talk gives an overview on new py.test features
of the last year. I'll discuss the minimal-boilerplate testing and new plugin
model and give an overview on which testing needs are covered so far, for
example:

  * run tests written for nose or unittest 
  * ad-hoc distribute tests to local or remote Python environments 
  * test compatibility with Python3 
  * run javascript unit-tests in real browsers 
  * coverage testing 
  * django-specific testing 

I'll conclude with upcoming features regarding testing-in-the-cloud and plans
on more test tool convergence. (URL: [http://pytest.org](http://pytest.org/))
