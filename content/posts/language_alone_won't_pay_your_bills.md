What’s Python like? Is it ready for the “enterprise”? Does it scale well in
the “cloud”? How does it stand against its old, bearded enemies like Java, or
new threats like Ruby? A lot of work on Python is focused on the language
itself, making it quite pleasant to read and write, and catering hordes of
language lovers that swear by it. Nowadays, though, we don’t just choose a
language: we pick a platform - which includes a runtime, APIs, and a lot of
tools - along with its strengths and weaknesses, and many factors should be
considered before doing so - mostly because we don’t usually have a “best
choice ever” and we must face some sort of tradeoff with each design choice.
Java is ubiquitous in the “enterprise software” world despite its
cumbersomeness - why? Is it really just a matter of slow adoption rate, or
does it still stand strong in some fields? We’ll explore where Python already
works well and where it falls beyond others, not just in terms of language
beauty, but in terms of tools and team productivity. We won’t be able to go
really deep into each aspect since time is limited, but questions are welcome.
