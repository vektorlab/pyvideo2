Part of our Master Member Profile project, the REALTOR search is a Web2py-based application, leveraging Elasticsearch, that aims to provide users (staff and members) with a means to query comprehensive member profiles. With relevant data gathered and presented via an easy-to-use centralized platform, staff can leverage information to enhance services provided to members and members to enhance productivity.
