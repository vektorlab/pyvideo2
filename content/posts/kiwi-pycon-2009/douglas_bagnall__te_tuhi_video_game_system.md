Te Tuhi Video Game System

Presented by Douglas Bagnall

Abstract

Tetuhi is a python program that turns drawings on paper into 2D top-down early
80s style video games. This talk describes how.

Outline

Te Tuhi Video Game System is not a game in itself; rather it creates games
based on arbitrary images that it is given. To use it, you draw a picture of
the game you want to play, and it will give you the game that you really drew.
The software was originally written for an art exhibit using slightly
specialised hardware, but it has been released under the GPL and runs on
ordinary computers. It uses Pygame, PIL, and custom C extensions that allow it
to evolve a playable game from a wide variety of pictures. This talk will
discuss the techniques used (both refined algorithms and hacky heuristics) and
cover topics such as image analysis, machine learning, and interface design.
There will be a demonstration.
