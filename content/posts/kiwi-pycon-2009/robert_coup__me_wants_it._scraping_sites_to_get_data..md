/me wants it. Scraping sites to get data.

Presented by Robert Coup

Abstract

Building scrapers for grabbing data from websites. Tools, techniques, and
tips.

Outline

Life would be so much easier if the data contained in websites was available
raw via APIs. Alas, until that mythical day comes we either need to deal with
unhelpful people via email and phone, or just get it ourselves. Python has
some great tools available to help with building scrapers and for parsing and
formatting the data we get. Starting off with the basics - tracking what needs
to be done, making web requests, parsing HTML, following links, and
extricating data from Excel and PDF documents. Our scraper needs to be
resilient against too-clever content management systems, Frontpage-era HTML,
and plain dodgy data. We may need to pass through logins and other messiness.
There are some techniques and tips for approaching the problems and keeping
your solution flexible and as simple as possible. We'll discuss some scrapers
built for New Zealand data, and introduce a new project from the NZ open
government data group to provide a RESTful interface to scrapers - effectively
creating a nice API where there isn't one.
