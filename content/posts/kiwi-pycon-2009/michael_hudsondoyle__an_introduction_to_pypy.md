An introduction to PyPy

Presented by Michael Hudson-Doyle

Abstract

An overview of the ideas behind the project, its current status, future plans
and why you should care about it.

Outline

The core idea of PyPy is to produce a flexible and fast implementation of the
Python programming language. The talk will cover the interpreter, translator
and jit parts of the code and their relationships and the fundamental ways in
which PyPy differs from other virtual machine implementations.
