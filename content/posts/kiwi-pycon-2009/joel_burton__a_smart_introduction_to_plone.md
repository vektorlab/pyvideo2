A smart introduction to Plone

Presented by Joel Burton

Abstract

The world of online content management systems has become so enormous that it
can be difficult to weigh the advantages--and disadvantages--of the systems.
The speaker, a noted Plone author and consultant, will demonstrate the
featureset of Plone, and provide real-world hints on the customer value and
challenges it provides.

Outline

Here, you can learn where Plone may serve your needs well, and where it might
be overkill or inappropriately deployed. You'll also learn approximate
budgets, in time and learning, you'd need to get up to speed on the system. In
addition, a demonstration of the upcoming features of Plone 4 and a future-
looking glance at the radically-redesigned Plone 5 will be given. Recommended
for new and casual users of Plone, and for people interested in understanding
its niche in the CMS/application development world.
