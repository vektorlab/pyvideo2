Tkinter doesn't suck, honest

Presented by Richard Jones

Abstract

In this talk I hope to dispel the myth that Tkinter just plain sucks through
the use of some concrete examples of simple use resulting in effective user
interfaces.

Outline

I intend to cover some basics of getting Tkinter GUIs up and running, and then
look at some simple use-cases, including: - file dialogs in minutes - script
configuration dialog - basics of interface design / packing - a look at the
widgets built in - a look at some of the extensions
