Title: 'Configuration management with ZooKeeper'
date: '2012-11-10'
---
This talk is about Jones, a robust configuration management interface for
Zookeeper. It will cover what ZooKeeper is, and how it works. I'll talk about
the problems of configuration management and how it can be solved using the
primitives available in ZooKeeper. If there's time I will go in to additional
use cases of ZooKeeper.
