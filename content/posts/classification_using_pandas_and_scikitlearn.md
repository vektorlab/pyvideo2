This will be a tutorial-style talk demonstrating how to use pandas and scikit-learn to do classification tasks. We will do some data munging and visualization using pandas and matplotlib. Then we will introduce some of the different classifiers in scikit-learn and show how to include them into a classification pipeline to produce the best predictive model. Interactive IPython/Jupyter notebooks will be provided.
