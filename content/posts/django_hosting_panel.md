Django Hosting Panel

Over the last year there's a been a whole new crop of specialized hosting
platforms for Django applications. In this panel, we speak to a number of the
people behind these new platforms to discuss what benefits they offer, what
challenges they face, and what the Django project/community can do to
encourage their growth.
