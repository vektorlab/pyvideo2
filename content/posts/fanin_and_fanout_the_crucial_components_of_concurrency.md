The most important yet underappreciated parts of concurrent APIs are good constructs for fan-out (one thread spawns others) and fan-in (many threads join together). This talk will show examples of fan-in and fan-out. It will cover the successes and shortcomings of APIs that provide concurrency. Finally, we'll discuss how the async model of Tulip/PEP3156 is the ultimate API. The future is bright!
