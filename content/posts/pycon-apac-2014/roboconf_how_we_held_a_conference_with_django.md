Title: 'Roboconf: How we held a conference with Django'
date: '2014-06-27'
---
Holding a conference needs continuous efforts, especially when you're in charge of all those administration stuff. Simple solutions could end up with management death spiral, while complex systems like Redmine would be an overkill. Roboconf is the home-made solution we've brought up: a conference operation site built upon Django, with issue tracking, document organizing, notifications, and staff management all in one place. In this session, I'll describe situations we faced when organizing SITCON 2013, how Roboconf got itself implemented, what difference it has made throughout the process, and crazy stuff other folks at SITCON built around this system.
