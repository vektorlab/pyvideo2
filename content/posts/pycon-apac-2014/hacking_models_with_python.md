Title: 'Hacking Models with Python'
date: '2014-06-26'
---
Although there are several data mining tools in python, you can use them to
deal with almost every kind of data (numeric, text, image, audio, ...) you met.
Besides, there are also lots of modeling tools in python, you can use them to
build the FIRST LIGHTING MODEL to solve the problems.

However, if you want to solve problems deeply, most of time, you need to write
down the customerized models and solve them by yourself. Instead of using fast
modeling tools, you need to know more about the essential things in modeling:

- What is a model ? 
- How models solve your problems ?
- What is the connection between models and data ?
- What is the important data ? important model ?

I deeply believe ... The more the connection between models and data you know, the deeper the problem you can solve.

Outline:
What is Modeling ?  
Data, Model, Evaluators  
Direct Problem: Data + Evaluators → Model  
Inverse Problem: Data + Models → Evaluator  
Hacking Models with Metric Learning  
Data as a Model & Model as a Data  
Duality between Dimension Reduction and Clustering
