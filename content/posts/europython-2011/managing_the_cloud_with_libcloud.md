Title: 'Managing the cloud with libcloud'
date: '2011-07-21'

libcloud is an open-source client library for interacting with different cloud
providers.

The primary goal of the library is to abstract all the provider differences
away and expose common functionality in a nice, clean and concise API.

This talk will address the following topics:

  * Why a library like this was built in the first place
  * Different problems we have encountered while building it (not all the providers always play nice)
  * An introduction to the library API (compute, storage and load-balancer part)
  * How to use it to build something useful and fun
  * How to participate and contribute
  * Roadmap and plans for the future
