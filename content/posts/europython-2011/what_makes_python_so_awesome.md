In a world of many programming languages, the popularity of Python continues
to grow without bound. We examine what makes it special and how it influences
the way we program:

  * what gives python its texture and feel
  * what features support rapid development
  * where does the readability come from
  * what features support economy of expression
  * look at the mix of lightweight tools and industrial grade tools
  * how easy is it to learn python? how hard is it to master
  * what can python do that other languages can't
  * what is the role of the python community
  * why does the license matter
  * does python just have zen or is there a python attitude?
