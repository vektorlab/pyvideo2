Title: 'Introduction to Gevent'
date: '2011-07-21'
---
[Gevent](http://gevent.org) is a coroutine-based library that enables you to
write highly-concurrent network and web applications. learn in detail what
Gevent is, what it does and how it does it.

I will introduce a coroutine-based approach to network programming, explain it
benefits and pitfalls. We will walk through the Gevent API, including the most
recent additions, and understand how it is implemented. I will make a quick
overview of the most interesting 3rd party add-on and applications after that.
