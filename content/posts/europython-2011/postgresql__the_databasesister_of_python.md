Title: 'PostgreSQL - the database-sister of Python'
date: '2011-07-13'
---
This talk is the updated and especially enhanced of the "Python and PostgreSQL
- a match made in heaven" talk of EP 2006, CERN, Switzerland. PostgreSQL and
Python share more then the first letter: their communities have great
similiarities; their development processes are really comparable; their
licenses and their openness to academics AND business (on a technical and
communitie perspective) are big pluses. We will have a look at those
similiarities and learn why PostgreSQL is really the database sister to
Python. There will be an overview of PostgreSQL, information of how to connect
PostgreSQL and Python; how PostgreSQL streaming replication works and what it
can do for you, how PL/Python helps to have Web 2.5 JSON storage and handling
right inside PostgreSQL. We will show that YESQL is also a valid answer to
many data storage qeuestions.
