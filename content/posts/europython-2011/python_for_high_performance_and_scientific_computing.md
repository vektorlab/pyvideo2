Title: 'Python for High Performance and Scientific Computing'
date: '2011-07-13'
---
Python is an accepted high-level scripting language with a growing community
in academia and industry. It is used in a lot of scientific applications in
many different scientific fields and in more and more industries, for example,
in engineering or life science). In all fields, the use of Python for high-
performance and parallel computing is increasing. Several organizations and
companies are providing tools or support for Python development. This includes
libraries for scientific computing, parallel computing, and MPI. Python is
also used on many core architectures and GPUs, for which specific Python
interpreters are being developed. A related topic is the performance of the
various interpreter and compiler implementations for Python. The talk gives an
overview of Pythonâ€™s use in HPC and Scientific Computing and gives information
on many topics, such as Python on massively parallel systems, GPU programming
with Python, scientific libraries in Python, and Python interpreter
performance issues. The talk will include examples for scientific codes and
applications from many domains.
