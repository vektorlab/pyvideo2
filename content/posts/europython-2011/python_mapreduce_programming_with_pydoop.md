Title: 'Python MapReduce Programming with Pydoop'
date: '2011-07-13'

Hadoop is the leading open source implementation of MapReduce, Google's large
scale distributed computing paradigm. Hadoop's native API is in Java, and its
built-in options for Python programming - Streaming and Jython - have several
drawbacks: the former allows to access only a small subset of Hadoop's
features, while the latter carries with it all of the limitations of Jython
with respect to CPython.

[Pydoop](http://pydoop.sourceforge.net) is an API for Hadoop that makes most
of its features available to Python programmers while allowing CPython
development. Its core consists of Boost.Python wrappers for Hadoop's C/C++
interface.

The talk consists of a MapReduce/Hadoop tutorial and a presentation of the
Pydoop API, with the main goal of bridging the gap between the Hadoop and
Python communities. A basic knowledge of distributed programming is helpful
but not strictly required.
