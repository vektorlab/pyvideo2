Title: 'Exploit your GPU power with PyCUDA (and friends)'
date: '2011-07-13'
---
CUDA technology permits to exploit the power of modern NVIDIA GPUs. In this
talk, after a brief introduction to GPU architecture, we will focus on how
CUDA got inside Python through libraries like PyCUDA and othersâ€¦

By some examples we will show the main concepts and techniques for good GPU
programming.

This talk targets anyone who wants to know how to exploit this technology from
Python, the suitable use cases, the using techniques and the do-not-using
techniques to get the best from his own GPU
