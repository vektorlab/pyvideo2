Title: 'Getting ready for PostgreSQL 9.1'

PostgreSQL is an advanced, versatile open-source database management system
that integrates perfectly with Python. It is developed by a very active
international community and is distributed under the BSD-like PostgreSQL
License.

Enterprise-class features (including SQL standard compliance, ACID
transactions, disaster recovery, high availability, replication, partitioning
and general extensibility) make PostgreSQL suitable for business critical
environments seeking to reduce the TCO of their database solutions without
altering their functional needs. PostgreSQL 9.0, released in September 2010,
was the first version of PostgreSQL with Hot Standby, a built-in master/slave
replication mechanism. Asynchronous replication through the standard and
consolidated log shipping technique (previously used with Warm Standby for
high availability) has been enhanced with streaming replication.

Version 9.1, expected to be out later in 2011, will add synchronous
replication to PostgreSQL, making it the first DBMS that allows developers and
users to control the replication strategy at transactional granularity. Come
to the talk and discover all the major new features of PostgreSQL 9.1,
including extensions management, writable common table expressions (WCTE),
etc.
