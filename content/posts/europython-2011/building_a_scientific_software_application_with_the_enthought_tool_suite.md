Title: 'Building a Scientific Software Application with the Enthought Tool Suite'
date: '2011-07-24'
---
The Enthought Tool Suite (ETS) is a collection of Python-based open source
components that form a foundation for nearly every application that we deliver
to our customers. In this talk I'll demonstrate how to use ETS to rapidly
develop an example scientific software application. We'll concentrate
particularly on introducing Traits, Traits UI, and the Chaco and Mayavi
visualisation tools.

Prerequisites: some previous experience of working with Python and NumPy /
SciPy is recommended.
