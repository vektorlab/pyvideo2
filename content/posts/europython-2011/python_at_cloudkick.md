Cloudkick is a server management and monitoring software as a service used by
thousands of different companies all across the globe.

The service is built in and powered by many different programming languages
and technologies, but the web application and majority of the backend services
are written in Python.

In this talk I will present how and where we use Python (Django, Twisted,
txamqp, Piston, â€¦), different problems we have encountered while building our
service and how we worked around them, good practices and real-world advices
on building effective Twisted services and much more.
