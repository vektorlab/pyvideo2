Title: 'Advanced Aspects of the Django Ecosystem: Haystack, Celery & Fabric'
date: '2011-07-18'
---
Django benefits from a thriving third-party ecosystem. This talk will take a
deep look at three of the components I have found most useful in my own
projects: Haystack for full-text search, Celery for offline processing and
Fabric for automated eployments. I'll discuss how we use them for Lanyrd.com,
and demonstrate why they deserve a permanent place in your toolbox.
