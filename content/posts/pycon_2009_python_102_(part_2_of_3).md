Python 102 Part 2 of 3)

  
This half-day tutorial presents intermediate and some advanced features of
Python to beginning and intermediate programmers. It pairs well with Python
101 following a similar outline but at a deeper level. Rather than starting
with "Hello, world!", we use the interactive Python interpreter to get hands-
on familiarity with much of core Python before covering blocks and scripts.
The tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and
exercises, to quickly cover lots of ground. Advanced topics are introduced
throughout and covered in "extra credit" exercises such that more advanced
participants can learn at their own pace.
