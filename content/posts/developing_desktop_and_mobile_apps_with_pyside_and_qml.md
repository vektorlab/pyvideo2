Title: '"Developing Desktop and mobile apps with PySide and QML"'
date: '2011-07-13'
---
PySide offers Python bindings to the Qt libraries. This allows rapid
development of great UI-based Python applications. With the addition of QML in
Qt 4.7, this now gives developers a chance to develop touch-based, rich
applications directly with Python. This talk introduces PySide development,
combined with QML, and shows some real-world examples of mobile PySide
applications.

This talk is based on my PySide/QML on [MeeGo tutorials](http://thp.io/2010
/meego-python/), and shows some of the possibilities. It is aimed at Python
developers looking for a GUI toolkit to create fluent, hardware-accelerated
cross-platform UIs using QML.
