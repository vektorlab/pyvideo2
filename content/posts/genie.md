This talk will introduce Genie, a new programming language with a Python-
inspired syntax that compiles into binary executables and libraries. Behind
the scenes, Genie is a dialect of Vala, and a full participant in the GObject
universe. I will cover the language basics, with an eye to comparing them with
Python, and guide you around some potential pitfalls. This is the second in a
series of talks I am giving on the topic of Python/GObject integration.
