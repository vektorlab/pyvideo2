The greatest piece of software in the world is useless without great
documentation, but unfortunately most of us just don't write great
docs. This can be fixed, though. Documentation doesn't need to be an
afterthought, and doesn't have to be bad, and you, too, can learn how
to write good docs and make that an integrated part of your
development process.
