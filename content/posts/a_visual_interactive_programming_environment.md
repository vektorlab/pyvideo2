Title: 'A Visual Interactive Programming Environment'
date: '2011-07-07'
---
The Larch Environment is a visual interactive programming environment for
Jython/Python. Its purpose is to make programming more visual. To this end,
protocols for presenting objects visually have been devised. A programming
environment, that builds on the idea of the standard visual console, allows a
programmer to experiment with ideas, and develop programs at the same time.
Additionally, a way of embellishing source code with visual content is
presented.
