Title: '"The London Python Code Dojo - an Education in Developer Education"'
date: '2011-07-24'
---
The London Python Code Dojo is a community organised monthly meeting for
Python programmers in the UK. Variously described as social coding, developer
training, "Scrapheap Challenge" for Pythonistas and "I didn't learn coding
like this when I was a lad", we've forked the traditional code-dojo format and
turned it into something very different.

This talk will explain and explore what happens in the dojo, how it's
organised and why various changes were made to the classic dojo format.
Reference will also be made to influences from music education and philosophy
of education.

Hopefully, by the end of the talk you'll all want to go organise a dojo!
