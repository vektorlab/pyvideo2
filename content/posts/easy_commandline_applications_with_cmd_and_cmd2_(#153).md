Easy command-line applications with cmd and cmd2

  
Presented by Catherine Devlin (IntelliTech Systems)

  
The Python Standard Library's cmd module makes it absurdly simple to write
command-line interpreters - non-graphical programs that communicate with users
interactively through a simple text interface. The third-party cmd2 module
adds high-powered "batteries" to applications written for cmd.

  
This presentation teaches attendees how to easily make their own powerful
command-line interpreters with cmd and cmd2. It also describes the tricks cmd2
uses for some of its more interesting functionality so that they can implement
them in their own programs (even unrelated ones). It ends with a brief
demonstration of sqlpython, a cmd2-based application that improves on existing
ad-hoc SQL applications.
