Title: '"From nothing to daily use - How Python changed my work life"'
date: '2013-09-12'

@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Sunday, 08 Sep 2013 - Track 1

**Audience level**

Novice

**Abstract**

I will share my experiences of writing small python tools to help me to solve the daily challenges of my job. I'm a very novice Python coder, and have only really been using

The range of tools I've used/built include:-

file format conversion, db building/analysing, XML wrangling, text data wrangling, object administration (inc. cleaning and audit), webscraping and basic workflow automation...

I will share some (terribly coded) examples of how I solve analysis challenges, share some limitations I have found being a solo novice coder on the edge of a professional IT environment, and ask for your guidance in how to maintain the same rate of learning in the coding space.

Title will change to be something more pithy.
