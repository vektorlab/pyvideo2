Benevolent Designer for Life's Keynote: Designers make it go to eleven

Presented by Idan Gazit

The open-source world is and always has been focused on code; attention and
respect doled out in exchange for patches. As a result, many open-source
projects want for design love but don't know how to secure it. We scare off
potential contributors from the many fields beneath the aegis of "design":
user experience, user interfaces, usability, interaction design, information
architects, graphic design, typography, and other roles assumed by the authors
of our markup and styling. Django can be a model citizen among open-source
projects in changing these attitudes and coaxing contributors out of the
woodwork -- not just for the benefit of the framework, but for the
constellation of 3rd party apps which make Django great. Other FOSS
communities have made efforts that we can learn from, and the fight to change
perceptions is less uphill than you might think. This talk will cover: -
Misconceptions of "Design." What is design, and what do designers do? - A
brief trip down memory lane, and how Django came to be relatively designer-
friendly. - "I don't get it: what is the BDesignFL role?" - Process and tools:
How can Django better engage designers, for core's benefit and for the benefit
of _your projects_. How can we help these contributors get over the "suck"
threshold? - What parts of core are ripe for love from designers? What 3rd
party projects?
