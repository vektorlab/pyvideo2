Title: '"Type python, press enter. What happens?"'
date: '2015-04-11'

This talk discusses how the Python interpreter starts, from the perspective of the operating system (OS). Together, we will see the ins & outs of processes: fork(), exec(), stdin, and stdout.

It focuses on OS concepts and requires no background knowledge, using analogies to Python data structures. (The talk does not discuss Pythonâ€™s own initialization, such as site.py or global variables.)
