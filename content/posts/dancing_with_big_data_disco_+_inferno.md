In our search for a better Map/Reduce framework we found Disco, an
Erlang/Python based Map/Reduce framework that's small, fast, elegant,
understandable. We needed a way to tame the power of Disco and that's when we
came up with the Inferno project which takes even more complexity out of
Map/Reduce. With Inferno you concentrate about what you want from your data
and not the underlying complexity.
