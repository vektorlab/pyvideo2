Genetic Programming in Python

Presented by Eric Floehr

Did you know you can create and evolve programs that find solutions to
problems? This talk walks through how to use Genetic Algorithms and Genetic
Programming as tools to discover solutions to hard problems, when to use
GA/GP, setting up the GA/GP environment, and interpreting the results. Using
[pyevolve](http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/), we'll walk through a real-world
implementation creating a GP that predicts the weather.

Abstract

Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Genetic Programming (GP) are methods used to
search for and optimize solutions in large solution spaces. GA/GP use concepts
borrowed from natural evolution, such as mutation, cross-over, selection,
population, and fitness to generate solutions to problems. If done well, these
solutions will become better as the GA/GP runs.

GA/GP has been used in problem domains as diverse as scheduling, database
index optimization, circuit board layout, mirror and lens design, game
strategies, and robotic walking and swimming. They can also be a lot of fun,
and have been used to evolve aesthetically pleasing artwork, melodies, and
approximating pictures or paintings using polygons.

GA/GP is fun to play with because often-times an unexpected solution will be
created that will give new insight or knowledge. It might also present a novel
solution to a problem, one that a human may never generate. Solutions may also
be inscrutable, and determining why a solution works is interesting in itself.
