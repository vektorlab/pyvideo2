The Python and the Elephant: Large Scale Natural Language Processing with NLTK
and Dumbo

  
Presented by Nitin Madnani (University of Maryland, College Park); Dr. Jimmy J
Lin (University of Maryland)

  
A practical look at NLTK and Dumbo, python-powered and open-source toolkits
and APIs for processing natural language on a large scale.

  
For people like us who make a living trying to make a computer "understand"
human language, Python is a very powerful language, given its rapid
prototyping abilities, native unicode support and a stellar standard library.
This relationship has been strengthened further by an open-source, python-
based Natural Language ToolKit ([www.nltk.org](http://www.nltk.org/)) which is
being widely used in the community for both teaching and research purposes and
gaining traction in the general Python community as well
([www.nltk.org/book](http://www.nltk.org/book)). Recently, the Python
community has seen the release of Dumbo ([http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumb
o](http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumbo)), an open-source, python-based
cloud-computing API (based on Hadoop) via the hands of Klaas Bosteels.

  
In this talk, we show how the amalgamation of Python, NLTK and Dumbo can allow
for very large-scale natural language processing efficiently and elegantly.
