Title: 'How we found our security best practices (and what they are)'
date: '2012-09-04'
---
Privacy and security are key parts of Mozilla's mission, and we build some of
the largest Django applications on the web, so being at the absolutely
forefront of security is crucial to us. And having a great user experience is,
too. So over the past few years, we've developed a number of proposals, tools
--like Bleach and django-ratelimit--and best practices, and we've wrapped
these up into our application template Playdoh and an app called Funfactory.

I'll share those best practices and their motivations. We'll also go over a
number of tools, settings, and even some fairly new web standard proposals
(with tools, of course) to help you build the most secure Django applications
you can, at whatever scale you're building.
