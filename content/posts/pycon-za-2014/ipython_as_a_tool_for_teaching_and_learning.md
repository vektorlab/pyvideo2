Title: 'IPython as a tool for teaching and learning'
date: '2014-10-02'

The ipython environment lends itself to teaching and learning: immediate feedback, flexible visualisation, easy access to docstrings and ability to explore modules.
With development of the ipython notebook, this is taken a step further, by providing browser-based access to an ipython environment with the ability to share notebooks with others, embed output products and annotate code.
I will present some experience of using ipython as a teaching tool in a tertiary teaching environment in Radio Astronomy courses in Windhoek, Nairobi and Cape Town.
