Genetic algorithms are a class of evolutionary algorithms, which have been
around since the mid 1950s. Since then, a lot of study has been done on these
algorithms, using them to solve various different types of problems. While
many frameworks exist to help develop and run evolutionary algorithms, mine is
aimed at simplicity for the user to create a program to execute an
evolutionary algorithm
