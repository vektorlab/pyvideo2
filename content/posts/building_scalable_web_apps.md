Title: 'Building Scalable Web Apps'
date: '2011-07-07'
---
Building scalable web applications may seem like a distant problem, but the
problem is not thinking about it before it's too late. This talk will focus on
designing a scalable web application before it needs to be (and avoiding the
premature optimization dilemma). It will cover topics such as efficient usage
of your database, appropriate caching (and invalidation!), and what the
speaker considers as best practices.
