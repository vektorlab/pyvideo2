Making Django awesomer

Presented by Richard Jones

Abstract

In this talk I will present a number of extensions to the core of Django that
will make your life a lot easier and/or awesomer.

Outline

I will:

  1. talk about how to find extensions, 
  2. walk through installing some common extensions, 
  3. look at the functionality provided by some developer tools, and 
  4. demonstrate the power of a social networking site extension 

Attendees should have some familiarity with Django.
