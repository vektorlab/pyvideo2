I'll introduce the WSGI ecosystem. We'll then setup a Django app and deploy it
to a VM. I'll cover server setup/config and best practices and cover software
used like Fabric, nginx etc. Sample nginx, WSGI and Apache configs will be
provided. People can follow along and I'll provide download links after so
they can try it at home. This will be the best meeting ever.
