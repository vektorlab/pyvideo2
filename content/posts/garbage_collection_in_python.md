This talk will explore how garbage collection is implemented in CPython and PyPy. See how CPython deals reference counting's shortcomings with a special GC for cycle collection. Then dive into PyPy's sophisticated and high-performing GC implementations. The particularly thorny issue of finalizers in reference cycles will also be addressed.
