How Python, TurboGears, and MongoDB are transforming SourceForge.net

  
Presented by Rick Copeland

  
In mid-2009, SourceForge embarked on a quest to modernize our websites,
starting with the download (consumer) flow on SourceForge.net. A small team
was tasked the rewrite, converting a site originally implemented in PHP with
Python. Using a customized TurboGears as a core component, the rewrite was
completed and the new site deployed in under 2 months. This talk tells the
story of that rewrite and explains our new technology stack, which includes
TurboGears, MongoDB, and Jinja templates.
