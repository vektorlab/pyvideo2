Distributed Programming with Pyro

  
Presented by Alfredo Deza

  
Create distributed code that communicates trivially over the network with
objects that answer as if they were local.

  
Send, receive and manage data with this powerful library. Presentation will
include real life example for restarting a load balanced web instance running
two Apache web servers and a MySQL database.

  
Although Python allows you to perform simple network operations, Pyro creates
a nice layer between core networking essentials and your code, allowing you to
concentrate more in developing your application.
