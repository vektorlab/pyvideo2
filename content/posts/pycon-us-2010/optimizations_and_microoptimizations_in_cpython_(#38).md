Optimizations and Micro-Optimizations in CPython

  
Presented by Mr. Larry Hastings

  
CPython mostly gets faster from one version to the next. And when CPython gets
faster, your programs get faster. This talk is a survey of optimizations made
to CPython, recent and historical, large and small. Audience doesn't need to
be familiar with CPython internals, but should be familiar with Python and
conversant in C.
