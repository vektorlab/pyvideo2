Writing Books using Python and Open Source Software

  
Presented by Mr. wesley j. chun

  
These days, there are countless number of software applications and web
services that have been developed using free and open source software (FOSS).
Such tools have become so flexible, powerful, and universal, that it should
also be possible for authors to write manuscripts using open source tools like
Python in the same way that applications are developed. In this talk, we
present some case studies of this phenomenon.
