IronPython Tooling

  
Presented by Dino E Viehland (Microsoft)

  
One of the most popular requests for the IronPython team is tooling support.
During this talk Iâ€™ll show you some of the existing tools available to help
create IronPython applications. Iâ€™ll also look at the latest IronPython
features which can help you debug, profile and improve your applications.
Iâ€™ll also compare and contrast these with the solutions available for
CPython that you may already be familiar with.
