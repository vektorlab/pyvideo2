How and why Python is being used by the Military to model real-world
battlefield scenarios

  
Mr. Eric Silverman (ALATEC Inc. / US Army)

at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico have converted a closed-form model,
which was developed for scripted Cold War scenarios, into a more sophisticated

poised to answer questions that have a direct effect on military operations
currently in theater, in large part because of Python.
