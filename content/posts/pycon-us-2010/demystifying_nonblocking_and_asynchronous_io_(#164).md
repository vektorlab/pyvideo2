Demystifying non-blocking and asynchronous I/O

  
Presented by Peter A Portante

  
We will first define what blocking, non-blocking, synchronous and asynchronous
I/O are under the POSIX interfaces. We'll cover how and when these four types
of I/O should be used, and their individual effects on a Python based
application. The notion of concurrency will be discussed by comparing a simple
threaded blocking I/O application to a simple single threaded non-blocking I/O
application by walking the attendees through the python code for those
applications.
