Pyine: Python 3 on Parrot

  
Presented by Allison Randal

  
Pynie is an implementation of Python 3 on Parrot. The goal of Pynie is to
duplicate the pure-Python behavior of CPython 3.x, and perhaps eventually a C
API compatibility layer. Parrot provides a set of compiler tools and core
functionality common to many dynamic languages, so the core code of Pynie is
lightweight. Pynie allows Python 3 libraries to be shared between multiple
languages. This talk is an overview of the features Pynie currently supports
and the work left to be done, together with an introduction to the internals
of Pynie.
