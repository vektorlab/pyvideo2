py.test I - rapid testing with minimal effort

Presented by Holger Krekel

Want to learn writing tests in Python? This tutorial introduces basic
practises using the popular py.test ([http://pytest.org](http://pytest.org))
tool. We start with an overview on testing and tools in Python and then
discuss and exercise basic idioms in a step-by-step manner. We cover the basic
writing, organisation and running of tests and debugging options. In the
second part we discuss setup and teardown of test state, usage and
configuration of test functions arguments and introduce coverage testing. We
will close with time to answer questions and discuss topics from the
participants.

Intended Audience

beginner programmers

Perequisites/knowledge: basic knowledge of python programming

Requirements: Laptop with Python 2.4 or greater installed. Pairing welcome.
