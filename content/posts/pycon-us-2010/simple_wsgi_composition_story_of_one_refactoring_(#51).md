Simple WSGI composition: story of one refactoring

  
Presented by Max Ischenko

  
Story of a refactoring I did to split one big, monolithic Pylons app into a
bunch of smaller ones, using power of WSGI and nginx. The devil is in the
details: how to handle common auth, site-wide look and feel, common utilities,
database management. Pros and cons of the approach, possible alternatives.

  
The talk assumes listeners know what WSGI is and preferably have used some
WSGI-centered framework like Pylons, Werkzeug, Paste or other.

  
The application this talk describes powers developers.org.ua.
