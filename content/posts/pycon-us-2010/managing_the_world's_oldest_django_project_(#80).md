Managing the world's oldest Django project

  
Presented by James Bennett

  
Or, "how we cut 40,000 lines of code and learned to love unit testing."

  
This talk will cover some of the development history behind Ellington, the CMS
which spawned the open-source Django web framework, and some of the issues
involved in developing and maintaining a codebase of this age and size.
Highlights include branch management, the advantages of open-sourcing non-
critical functionality, the pain of porting and the joy that can only be found
in a passing test suite.
