Remixing Music Pythonically

Presented by Adam T. Lindsay

The Echo Nest Remix API ([http://code.google.com/p/echo-nest-
remix/](http://code.google.com/p/echo-nest-remix/)) was made open source by
The Echo Nest, a "music intelligence" company based in the Boston area in the
autumn of 2008. This talk will offer details on the concise expressivity
offered when editing multimedia driven by content-based features, and some
insights on what Pythonic magic did and didn't work in the development of the
modules. Audio and video examples of the fun-yet-odd outputs that are possible
will be shown.
