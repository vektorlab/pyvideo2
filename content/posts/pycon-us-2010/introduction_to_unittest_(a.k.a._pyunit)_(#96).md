Introduction to Unittest (a.k.a. PyUnit)

Presented by Chander K Ganesan

The PyUnit (unittest) unit testing framework provides an easy-to-use set of
tools and techniques to add robust unit testing to your Python code. By
integrating unit testing in their code, developers allow for a robust set of
tools to quickly and easily identify "broken" code.

In this session we'll explore the unittest module and demonstrate how to
leverage PyUnit for unit testing.
