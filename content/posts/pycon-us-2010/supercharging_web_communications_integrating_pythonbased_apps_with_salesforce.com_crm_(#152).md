Supercharging Web Communications: Integrating Python-based Apps with
Salesforce.com CRM

  
Presented by Christopher Johnson

  
Salesforce.com is a leading provider of Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
for enterprises (over 55,000 customers) and nonprofits (over 6,000 customers).
While it handles sales, marketing and support processes, it can be extended to
automate any business process, making it a core part of business operations.
Python developers working with companies using salesforce.com need to be able
to integrate applications with Salesforce. Luckily, Salesforce.com has an
elegant and powerful SOAP API. This presentation will introduce an example of
using the Python wrapper for the Salesforce.com API (Beatbox) in an
interactive website. While the library itself is powerful and can be used in
custom Python applications, the Python community can also leverage the
advanced integration between the Plone Content Management System (CMS) and
salesforce.com. We will demonstrate how a Plone website can post forms,
ecommerce transactions, and event RSVPs to salesforce. Additionally, we will
show how developers can make Salesforce.com data interactive in a Plone
website.
