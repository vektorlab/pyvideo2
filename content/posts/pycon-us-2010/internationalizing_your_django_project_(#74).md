Internationalizing your Django project

  
Presented by Matt Croydon (Mediaphormedia)

  
Internationalizing your Django application isn't as hard as it sounds. This
session introduces the topic of internationalization and walks through what it
takes to use Django's internationalization tools, including how to mark
models, views, and templates for translation and how to enable
internationalization in your application. We will also step through localizing
your application in a new language.
