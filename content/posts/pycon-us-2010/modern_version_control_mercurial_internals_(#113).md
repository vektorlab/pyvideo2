Modern version control: Mercurial internals

Presented by Dirkjan Ochtman

In this talk, I'd like to talk a bit about Mercurial. This will not be a
beginner-level talk on DVCS or hg; it aims to be a higher-level discussion of
the concepts employed in Mercurial. After having discussed these, I'd also
like to compare Mercurial and git based on UI, performance and underlying
concepts.
