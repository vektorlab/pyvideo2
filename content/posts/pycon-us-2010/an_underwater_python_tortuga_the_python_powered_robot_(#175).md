An Underwater Python: Tortuga the Python Powered Robot

  
Presented by Joseph Lisee (Robotics @ Maryland)

  
Learn about Tortuga, the python powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)
developed by Robotics @ Maryland ([http://ram.umd.edu](http://ram.umd.edu)).
See how python provides a flexible and efficient way to build the software
that commands, simulates and controls Tortuga. Also learn about the trials,
tribulations, and glory experienced developing, competing, losing, and winning
with Tortuga in AUVSI AUV Competition ([http://www.auvsi.org/competitions/wate
