The Meaty Parts of Python: Closures, Decorators, List Comprehension, and
Functional Constructs

Presented by Matt Harrison

Are you new to Python and want to learn how to step it up to the next level?
Have you wondered about functional programming, closures, decorators,
generators or list comprehensions and when you should use them? This hands-on
tutorial will cover these intermediate subjects in detail, by explaining the
theory behind them then walking through examples. It will also cover how to
test such programs. The session will conclude with some basic problems to work
through.

Outline:

  * Testing (45 min) 
    * unittest 
    * doctest 
    * brief code coverage intro 
    * other testing tools 
  * Functional Programming (15 min) 
    * lambda 
    * map 
    * reduce 
    * filter 
    * Substitutes for above constructs 
  * Functions (20 min) 
    * callables 
    * arguments (args, kw) 
    * mutable parameters 
  * Scoping (10 min) 
  * Closures (5 min) 
  * Decorators (20 min) 
    * Simple decorators 
    * parameterized decorators 
    * mangling 
    * templates for decorators 
    * classmethod staticmethod 
  * Properties (5 min) 
  * List comprehensions (10 min) 
  * Iterator pattern (5 min) 
  * Generators (15 min ) 
  * Hands-on application (50 min)
