The Zen of CherryPy

  
Presented by Robert E Brewer

  
CherryPy will be 8 years old in June 2010! This presentation will look at the
"Zen of CherryPy": a set of 10 design guidelines which CherryPy has developed
over those years, explaining why they're useful, why some are uniquely Python,
and how to apply them in your own projects.
