wxPython II: Introduction to GUI Programming and MVC

Presented by David Goodger

wxPython is an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that runs on
multiple platforms, including Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. By the end of this
tutorial, attendees will understand the concepts behind the Model-View-
Controller (MVC) design pattern and will have built a complex wxPython
application.

Intended Audience

Python programmers (of any level; familiarity with Python is assumed) with
some wxPython experience. Attending the "wxPython I" tutorial is recommended.

Requirements

Attendees are welcome to bring a laptop loaded with Python 2.4+ and wxPython
2.6+ to follow along, but this is not required.
