Extending Java Applications with Jython

  
Presented by Frank J Wierzbicki (Jython)

  
Jython is an implementation of Python for the JVM. This talk covers the
options available for integrating Jython and Java code, especially Java
calling into Jython, since this is the trickier case. This talk will also
cover some Java specific deployment options, such as deploying your Jython
application as a jar file. Jar files allow you to package Java/Jython
applications into a single archive. In many environments a user can click on a
jar file to launch the contained application.
