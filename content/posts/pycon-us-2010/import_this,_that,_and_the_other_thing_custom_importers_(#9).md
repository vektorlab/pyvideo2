Import this, that, and the other thing. Custom importers

  
Presented by Brett Cannon

  
Since Python 2.3, the ability has existed to customize the import process so
that one can support code stored in alternative formats, e.g. zipimport and
its support of importing code from a zip file. The aim of this talk is to make
sure you understand how the custom import mechanism works and how to write
your own custom importers using importlib from Python 3.1.
