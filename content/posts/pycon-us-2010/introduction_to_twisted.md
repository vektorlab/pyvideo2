Introduction to Twisted

Presented by Chander Ganesan

Interested in faster networking with Python? Twisted is an event-driven
networking engine written in Python that allows developers to quickly and
easily develop and deploy network services.

In this tutorial, attendees will learn what twisted is, why to use it, how it
works, and how to install, develop, and deploy simple clients and servers
using Twisted.

Attendees should bring a laptop if possible, to try out code examples in
class.

Intended Audience

oriented syntax (classes, inheritance, etc.)
