To relate or not to relate, that is the question

  
Presented by Mark Ramm

  
There is a lot of buzz about Couch, Casandra, MongoDB, and other non

talk will focus on comparing relational DB's to their new friends in practice,
and on providing practical tools for deciding what's right for your project.
