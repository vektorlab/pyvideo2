The Speed of PyPy

  
Presented by Maciej Fijalkowski (merlinux GmbH, pypy)

  
The first part of the talk will cover PyPy's speed achievements resulting from
the last year's work on the Just-In-Time Compiler. I'll present and discuss a
number of benchmarks and compare against other Python-speed projects. I'll
also cover the basics of how the JIT works and what sort of programs it can
greatly speedup (and which ones it can't).
