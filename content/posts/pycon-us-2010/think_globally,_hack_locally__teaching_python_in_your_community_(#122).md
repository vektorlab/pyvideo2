Think Globally, Hack Locally - Teaching Python in Your Community

  
Presented by Leigh Honeywell (HackLab.TO)

  
For over a year, HackLabTO ([http://hacklab.to](http://hacklab.to/)), a
hackerspace in Toronto, has been the home of an informal Python class / hack
night every Thursday evening. Our participants represent a diverse cross-
section of the lab's community, and include everyone from complete beginners
who hadn't written code since BASIC in high school, to seasoned veterans. Come
hear about our successes and failures, and learn how to start such an event in
your local community.
