Title: 'Python + Geographic Data = BFFs'
date: '2014-04-12'
---
Python is so well-suited for processing and managing geographic data, I think they'll be best friends forever. In this talk, I'll introduce some of the best Python libraries to use with your geodata, and show you how treating GeoJSON like a Python dictionary can make cleaning and validating your data a breeze. I'll also discuss examples of using Python to add custom functionality to GIS software.
