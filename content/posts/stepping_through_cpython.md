Ever wondered how CPython actually works internally? This talk will show you.
We start with a simple Python program, then slowly step through CPython,
showing in exhaustive detail what happens when it runs that program. Along the
way we'll examine the design and implementation of various major CPython
subsystems and see how they fit together. The audience should be conversant in
C and Python.
