Introducing Python to a Java shop

Presented by Juergen Brendel (MuleSoft)

There is a time and place for everything: For some applications Python is
perfect, for others a language like Java and its entire ecosystem is more
ideal. In this talk we see how Python was introduced to a Java shop as a
vehicle for rapid and dynamic prototyping of a new project. The talk then
explains how Jython/Java integration was used to translate this project step
by step from Python to Java. Going beyond the advocacy focus, the talk then
shows the interfaces to call Java from Python and vice versa and illustrates
those with examples. Furthermore, unit testing of Java classes via test cases
written in Python is also touched upon.
