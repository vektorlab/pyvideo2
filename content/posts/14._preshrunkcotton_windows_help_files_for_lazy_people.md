Generating a Compiled HTML Help (CHM) file is often necessary when
distributing applications on Microsoft Windows platforms. However, many
developers may dislike authoring HTML and/or cannot use Microsoftâ€™s help
tools. preshrunk-cotton streamlines the creation of CHM files by allowing the
author to quickly write documentation in Textile markup and build the help
file on almost any platform.
