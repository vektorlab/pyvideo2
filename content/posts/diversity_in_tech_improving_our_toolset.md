Diversity in Tech: Improving our Toolset

Presented by Jennifer Leech

As communities allow more diversity, they draw from a larger talent pool,
challenge each other more, and hit a higher bar in terms of ingenuity and
work-product. However questions surrounding diversity often seem under-
examined. What are the effects of diversity in the community, or lack thereof?
I intend to approach this topic from an accessible and entertaining, yet
analytical perspective.

Abstract

Last year there was a photo of Kate Moss shown during a PyCon presentation
which raised debate as to its appropriateness. This debate brought up some
interesting questions - but what I found most interesting was that while it
elicited strong opinions, the issue seemed to be somewhat unexamined. This
event sparked a desire for deeper analysis on this topic in a more focussed
setting.

In this talk, I intend to address some of the core principles underlying this
debate. Discussion will include the following questions: Where does
responsibility lie in understanding these issues? What are the effects of
failing to do so? What are the effects of diversity in the community, or lack
thereof? What do we lose by being more homogenous or more diverse? Gain?

As communities allow more diversity, they draw from a larger talent pool,
challenge each other more, and hit a higher bar in terms of ingenuity and
work-product. However, diversity requires awareness and tolerance on both the
part of the dominant culture and on the part of the new arrivals to smooth the
inevitable rough edges.

I intend to approach this topic from an accessible, inclusive and
entertaining, yet analytical perspective. The broader intent is to raise the
level of understanding and community discourse on this topic. It is odd that
diversity can so dramatically affect our lives and communities and yet be
unexamined, particularly in a community so highly intelligent and educated as
that which populates the tech industry.
