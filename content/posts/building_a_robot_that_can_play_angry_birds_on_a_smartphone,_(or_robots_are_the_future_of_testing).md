Can your robot play Angry Birds? On an iPhone? Mine can. I call it
"BitbeamBot". It started as an art project, but it has a much more serious
practical application: mobile web testing. To trust that your mobile app truly
works, you need an end-to-end test on the actual device. BitbeamBot is an
Arduino-powered open-source hardware CNC robot that can test any application
on any mobile device.
