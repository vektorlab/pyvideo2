Powerful Pythonic Patterns video

Presented by Alex Martelli

An extremely misguided meme is going around: that Python doesn't have, or
need, any Design Patterns. Maybe the meme springs from not realizing what the
Gang Of Four state so plainly in their historical "Design Patterns" book:
which design patterns are useful DOES depend on the programming language one
targets -- design is NOT independent of implementation, as the epic-fail
"Waterfall" Methodology Pattern would suggest. If you examine a "classic DP"
that's basically a workaround for some other language's lack of garbage
collection, or for a clumsy static-typing system, it may indeed be worthless
for Python. But many other DPs are still perfectly useful and applicable, and
indeed Python's strengths as a language afford riffing on them to develop
highly Pythonic, powerful, productive variants.

In this talk, I analyze some of my favorite pattern families -- e.g., Template
Method and its variants, Dependency Injection and its ilk, Callback and
friends -- in a highly Pythonic context. Non-pattern Idioms, and Patterns that
aren't really Design Patterns but rather Architecture or Methodology ones,
also make cameo appearances.
