Title: '"Advanced Database Programming with Python"'
date: '2014-07-25'
---
The Python DB-API 2.0 provides a direct interface to
many popular database backends. It makes interaction with
relational database very straight forward and allows tapping
into the full set of features these databases provide.

The talk will cover advanced database topics which are
relevant in production environments such as locks, distributed
transactions and transaction isolation.

----

The talk will give an in-depth discussion of advanced database
programming topics based on the Python DB-API 2.0: locks and
dead-locks, two-phase commits, transaction isolation, result
set scrolling, schema introspection and handling
multiple result sets.

Talks slides are available on request.
