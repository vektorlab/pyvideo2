Title: '"Karaage Gardening"'
date: '2015-08-04'
---
Karaage is an open source Python/Django application for managing users and projects on HPC clusters. It is being used in production in a number of sites across Australia. This talk will discuss turning a messy legacy software base into a modern software platform that is much a cleaner mess ("gardening"). I will also talk about some of the lessons learnt along the way, including things that went well, and things that could have been handled better.
