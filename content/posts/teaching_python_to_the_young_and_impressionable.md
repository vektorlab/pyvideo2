Title: '"Teaching Python to the young and impressionable"'
date: '2011-08-22'
---
We present two outreach programmes run by Sydney University for high school
students: the National Computer Science School (http://www.ncss.edu.au) and
the Girls' Programming Network (http://sydney.edu.au/it/gpn). For the past
four years we have been teaching Python to students in grades 9-12, and based
on this experience we will discuss why Python is a good first language and the
parts of it which are still difficult for students to grasp.
