What We've Learned from Building Basie

  
Presented by Dr. Greg Wilson (University of Toronto)

  
Since September 2008, teams of undergraduates from half a dozen different
universities have been building a Django-based replacement for Trac called
Basie. This talk will present what they've accomplished and discuss what we've
learned about getting junior developers who are juggling half a dozen projects
at once to build production-quality code.
