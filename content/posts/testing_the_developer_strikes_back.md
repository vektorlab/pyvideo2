Testing: The Developer Strikes Back

Sandy Strong

“Code not tested is broken by design” - Jacob Kaplan-Moss

Every programming project has unique testing needs. It’s not always easy to
understand what those needs are, or how to write tests that satisfy them. One
of our goals as developers is to write tests that minimize failures in
production that can cost our companies time, money, resources, and in many
cases, hours of sleep!
