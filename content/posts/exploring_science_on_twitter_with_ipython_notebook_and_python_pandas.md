@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Sunday, 08 Sep 2013 - Track 1

**Audience level**

Intermediate

**Abstract**

I'm studying Science Communication and looking at how people use the word science on Twitter as a way of understanding what they might mean when they say 'science'. My initial dataset is 13.5 million tweets I collected during 2011. Since the start of 2012 I've been using Python for my data analysis.

I'll demonstrate how I've been using IPython notebook [1] with the Pandas [2] data analysis library to work with large data tables and time series data. The IPython notebook is a great tool for research, allowing notes about research to be kept interleaved with the python code. The ability to quickly see results and plot them using Matplotlib [3] encourages interactive exploration of the data.
