Title: '"Spinning a Web Framework"'
date: '2013-10-16'
---
Over the years I've been exposed to a lot of ideas in web frameworks. Reflecting on these ideas is valuable when you build a new one, but also when you simply use an existing web framework.

In this talk I will discuss the slow genesis of Morepath, a micro web-framework with super powers that I've created, and discuss some of the ideas behind it, things I've learned, and also share some thoughts about the creative process.

The ideas behind Morepath are not revolutionary, but hopefully still make you think.
