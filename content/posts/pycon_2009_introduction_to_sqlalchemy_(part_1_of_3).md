[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: some buzzing ] SQLAlchemy is the premier SQL toolkit for
Python. SQLAlchemy exposes the full power of SQL while remaining easy to use
for the basics, and is flexible enough to work with existing database schemas
as well as fresh designs. SQLAlchemy is used in production by leading Python
web frameworks Pylons and Turbogears as well as many other web and non-web
developers. This tutorial teaches SQLAlchemy's object-relational mapping to
automate painlessly loading and persisting objects from and to your database,
even when complex relationships exist.
