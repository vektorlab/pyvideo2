Building web animation application with Python-ogre

Presented by Indy Liu

Abstract

In building our online user-customisable animation system, we needed a 3D
engine that is powerful, stable and flexible. We are lucky to have made
python-ogre our choice. Combined with FFMpeg and the boto library, we were
able to build the whole solution in python with as little hassle as possible.

Outline

  * Open source python game engines; 
  * What we need - Not just a game engine; 
  * What you can do with python-ogre; 
  * Combining with other libraries FFMpeg, boto; 
  * Interfacing with the web - celery;
