As more of the world is controlled by software, software developers have an increasing obligation to serve that world well.  Yet, we don't yet have a sense of what makes a good ethical standard.  The fast pace, success, and youth (in both historical and demographic terms) of our industry have given us the sense that such a standard might not be required.
