Using Python to Create Robotic Simulations for Planetary Exploration (#159)

Presented by Dr. Jonathan M Cameron (Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA))

The primary activity of the Dartslab (http://dartslab.jpl.nasa.gov) at Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is to create simulations of robotic vehicles for
planetary exploration. We have created simulations of a wide variety of
robotic vehicles such as spacecraft, rovers, and airships. We have been using
Python in a variety of ways to build our simulations. In this talk we will
outline how we use Python to set up a runtime environment for our simulations
and to tie together computationally intense C++ code modules at runtime. We
will also discuss how we have been using Python to help prototype and design
C++ code.
