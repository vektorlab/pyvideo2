Introduction to Internet Programming (Wesley J. Chun)

Python is an interpreted, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language
that is popular for a wide range of applications, one of which is Internet
programming. This tutorial introduces current Python programmers to 3-4
distinct areas of Internet programming, each in self-contained lectures with a
demonstration of code following each lecture topic. Intended Audience

Developers familiar with Python who are interested in exploring client/server
network programming with sockets, Internet client (FTP, NNTP, e-mail),
development and web programming.

Class Outline

Python is an interpreted, cross-platform, object-oriented programming language
that is popular for a wide range of applications, one of which is Internet
programming. This tutorial introduces current Python programmers to distinct
areas of Internet programming, each in self-contained lectures with a
demonstration of code following these lecture topics (each ranging from
20-60min in length):

  * Network Programming using Sockets 
  * Internet Client Programming 
  * Web/CGI Programming and Concepts 
  * Intro to Django (time-permitting) 

We start at the lowest layer, where one creates communication channels
directly between clients and servers using sockets then move up one level to
discuss well-known Internet protocols such as FTP. Then we move up even higher
to address the concept of web programming, including a description and purpose
of all "CGI" interfaces, and finally, if there's time, to give a high-level
quick introduction to one of the most popular Python web frameworks today,
Django. We'll try build and implement a simple blog in 15-20 minutes! This is
especially for those of you who couldn't sign up for the intro to Django
tutorial at this PyCon which will likely be full.
