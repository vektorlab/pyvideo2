Tests and Testability

  
Presented by Ned Batchelder

  
Testing software is difficult. Large complex systems don't lend themselves
naturally to automated testing. This isn't just because they are large, it's
because developers often don't consider how testable their code is.
Testability is as important as all the other -ilities in your code
(portability, maintainability, efficiency, etc).

  
Testability is a characteristic of your code that makes it easier to test.
Increased testability can give you better tests, but it also gives you just
plain better code. Improving testability generally means considering the
interfaces to your internal modules and improving them to provide better
modularity. This improvement often has benefits in your product code.

  
I'll discuss specific examples to demonstrate how code can be made more
testable. Mocks, dependency injection, and crisp API design are just a few of
the techniques that can improve your code's testability and make you a happier
person.
