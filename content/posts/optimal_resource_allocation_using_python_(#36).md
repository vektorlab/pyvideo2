Optimal Resource Allocation using Python

  
Presented by Ryan J O'Neil

  
A brief introduction to modeling and solving resource allocation and
scheduling problems using Python and SCIP.

  
At times a programmer is faced with difficult, possibly NP-Hard, optimization
problems such as scheduling or assignment. Sophisticated techniques exist for
modeling and solving these sorts of problems which are well implemented in
optimization solvers. This talk introduces some of these techniques using the
ZIB Optimization Suite and its new Python interface.
