SchoolTool is an FOSS student information system developed in Python using the
Zope 3 framework. It has several basic components a teacher could use:
gradebook, attendance, calendars, etc and some "advanced" ones like
interventions and skill tracking. It's easily available in the Ubuntu Linux
distribution.
