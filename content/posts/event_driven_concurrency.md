Title: '"Event Driven Concurrency"'
date: '2012-09-13'
---
Ben recently discovered event driven concurrency. He will be talking about
some of the basics as well as trying to compare it with other concurrency
options. The focus will be on its application in a few recent projects as well
as a comparison of Python's gevent and node.js. Some of the demos will also be
using matplotlib in honor of John Hunter's passing.
