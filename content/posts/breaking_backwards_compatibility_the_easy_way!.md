Title: 'Breaking backwards compatibility: The easy way!'

Say you have this piece of software that many people use. One day, you wake up and you have the urge to make them suffer. Well, there’s no better way to do so than breaking the software they’re using.

In this talk, I’ll walk you through very good ways to do so by showing examples taken from experience - because experience is the only thing that matters (TM) - so that you’ll be able, by the time this talk ends, to do the same to your users.

(P.S: If you’ve a kinder hearth, you can also do the exact opposite of what I’ll say and keep your users happy.)
