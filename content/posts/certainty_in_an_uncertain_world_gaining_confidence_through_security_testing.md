Title: '"Certainty in an Uncertain World: Gaining Confidence through Security Testing"'
date: '2012-03-09'
---
Nobody thinks you have to be a performance expert to write performance tests-
why assume that you have to be a security expert to write security tests?
During this presentation I'll show you how to use fuzzers, attack tools, and
other simple techniques to help protect your users, improve the strength of
your existing tests, and gain confidence in the security of your code. There
will be demos!
