@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 2

**Audience level**

Intermediate

**Abstract**

Python's Metaclasses are an "advanced" technique, but once you get started they're surprisingly approachable.

Starting with the basics, we'll:

* figure out what a metaclass does
* point out some existing metaclasses you might already have used
* see where you might use one in your own code.

We'll compare use of a metaclass with some alternatives that don't use metaclasses, to better understand why you'd want to use them.

Then we'll take a look at a couple of use-cases where using a metaclass helps us achieve a much more friendly and intuitive API than we otherwise could.
