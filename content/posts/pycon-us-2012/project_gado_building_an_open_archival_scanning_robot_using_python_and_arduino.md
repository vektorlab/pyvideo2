Title: 'Project Gado: Building an Open Archival Scanning Robot Using Python and Arduino'
date: '2012-03-10'
---
Project Gado is an initiative which aims to create an open-source archival
scanning robot which small archives can purchase for $500 and use to
autonomously scan their photographic collections. This talk presents the Gado
2, a prototype scanning robot built around Python and Arduino, and shares
lessons learned from using Python as the primary language in a large-scale
archival scanning project.
