Title: '29. Keeping the Chandra satellite cool with Python and Xija'
date: '2012-03-11'
---
The Chandra X-ray Observatory has been producing significant astronomical
discoveries since its launch by NASA in July of 1999. The Chandra operations
team uses Python for predictive thermal modeling of the spacecraft to maintain
a safe thermal environment. This poster describes the Xija modeling framework
that is used to create, calibrate, and compute these thermal models.
