Title: 'Introduction to PDB'
date: '2012-03-09'
---
PDB is an interactive debugging environment for Python programs. It allows you
to pause your program, look at the values of variables, and watch program
execution step-by-step, so you can understand what your program is actually
doing, as opposed to what you think it's doing. This talk will show novice and
intermediate Python users how to use PDB to troubleshoot existing code.
