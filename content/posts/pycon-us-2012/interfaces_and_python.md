Title: 'Interfaces and Python'
date: '2012-03-09'
---
In 2.6, Python introduced the Abstract Base Classes. Before that we had
"protocols" (and we still do). In this talk we'll look at how the general
concept of interfaces fits into today's Python. We'll also look at some of the
alternate proposals of the past, some of the controversies around ABCs, and
the direction interfaces might go in the future.
