Title: 'Designing Embedded Systems with Linux and Python'
date: '2012-03-10'
---
The continual decrease in the cost of computer hardware is allowing more
embedded systems to be built with Linux and Python, instead of the traditional
approach of a real-time operating system and C. This talk reviews the
differences between those approaches and describes problems, solutions, and
tools that can be used when building embedded systems with Python.
