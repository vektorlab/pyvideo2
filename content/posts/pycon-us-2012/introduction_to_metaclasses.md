Title: 'Introduction to Metaclasses'
date: '2012-03-09'
---
Python's metaclasses grant the Python OOP ecosystem all the power of more
complex object inheritance systems in other languages, while retaining for
most uses the simplicity of the straightforward class structures most
developers learn when being introduced to object-oriented programming. This
talk is an explanation of metaclasses: first, what they are, and second, how
to use them.
