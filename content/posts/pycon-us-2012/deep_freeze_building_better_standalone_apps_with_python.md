Title: 'Deep Freeze: building better stand-alone apps with Python'
date: '2012-03-11'
---

over your code. Want to deploy automatic updates? Want to be sure it runs on
legacy platforms? Want to add professional touches like code signing? And want
to do this all in a cross-platform manner? This talk will show you the tools
you can use to make your frozen apps better in a variety of small yet
important ways.
