Title: '48. Advanced Parallel Primitives in SPM.Python for Data and Graph Analytics'
date: '2012-03-11'
---
Traditional solutions for data and graph analytics tend to be highly
fragmented, and take the form of stand-alone frameworks. In this poster
session, we shall describe our approach that is centered around a suite of
advanced parallel primitives embedded within SPM.Python. These primitives
augment the serial Python language with concepts like parallel generators,
emitters and exceptions.
