Title: 'Code Generation in Python: Dismantling Jinja'
date: '2012-03-09'
---
For many DSLs such as templating languages it's important to use code
generation to achieve acceptable performance in Python. The current version of
Jinja went through many different iterations to end up where it is currently.
This talk walks through the design of Jinja2's compiler infrastructure and why
it works the way it works and how one can use newer Python features for better
results.
