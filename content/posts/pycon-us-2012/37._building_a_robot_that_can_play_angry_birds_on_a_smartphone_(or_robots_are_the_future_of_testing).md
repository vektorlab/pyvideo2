A poster session for a hands-on demo of "BitbeamBot". It started as an art
project, but it has a much more serious practical application: mobile web
testing. To trust that your mobile app truly works, you need an end-to-end
test on the actual device. BitbeamBot is an Arduino-powered open-source
hardware CNC robot that can test any application on any mobile device.
