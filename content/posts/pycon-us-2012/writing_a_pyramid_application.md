Pyramid is the web framework at the core of the Pylons Project. It's a "pay
only for what you eat" framework. You can get started easily and learn new
concepts as you go, and only if you need them. It's simple, well tested, well
documented, and fast. This course will present Pyramid and lead you through
the creation of a an application as the concepts from the framework are
introduced.
