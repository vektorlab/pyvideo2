date: '2012-03-10'

The presentation introduces the possibilities to use HDF5 (Hierarchical Data
Format) from Python. HDF5 is one of the fastest ways to store large amounts of
numerical data. The talk is for scientist who would like to store their
measured or calculated data as well as for programmers who are interested in
non-relational data storage.
