Title: 'Why PyPy by example'
date: '2012-03-10'

One of the goals of PyPy is to make existing Python code faster, however an
even broader goal was to make it possible to write things in Python that
previous would needed to be written in C or other low-level language. This
talk will show examples of this, and describe how they represent the
tremendous progress PyPy has made, and what it means for people looking to use
PyPy.
