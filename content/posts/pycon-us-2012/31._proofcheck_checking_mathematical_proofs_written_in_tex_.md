Title: '31. ProofCheck: Checking Mathematical Proofs written in TeX '
date: '2012-03-11'
---
ProofCheck is a set of Python scripts which parse and check mathematics
written using TeX. Its homepage is www.proofcheck.org. Unlike computer proof
assistants which require immersion in the equivalent of a programming
language, ProofCheck attempts to handle mathematical language formalized
according to the author's preferences as much as possible.
