Title: 'Hand Coded Applications with SQLAlchemy'
date: '2012-03-10'
---
SQLAlchemy is the object relational mapper and database toolkit for Python,
first introduced in 2005. In this talk I'll describe why SQLAlchemy has always
been called a "toolkit", detailing the software construction mindset for which
SQLAlchemy was designed to be used with - what I am currently referring to as
the "Hand Coded" approach.
