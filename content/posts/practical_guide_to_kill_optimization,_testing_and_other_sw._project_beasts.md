Title: 'Practical guide to kill optimization, testing and other sw. project beasts'
date: '2012-07-05'
---
Optimization, testing, tunning and design in sw. project can be both heaven or
hell for a sw. development project. Python provides many tools to deal with
these topics but by theirselves they could not be enough. The talk tries to
expose techniques, self failures/success and practical tips and hints to make
the right choice at the right time. This talk will expose optimization,
testing, tunning patterns ( and other critical topics ) of a python project
and try to analyze the options python provides ( such as packages, techiniques
and patterns/anti-patterns ) to deal with them. There is not one true way to
deal with these topics and the main goal of the talks is to provide practical
examples/techniques and create an active discussion with the public. Main
discussion topics: Testing ( modules and techniques ) Optimization and
performance ( analysis of the problem, profiling and tuning techniques )
Debugging Deployment and automation Python traps
