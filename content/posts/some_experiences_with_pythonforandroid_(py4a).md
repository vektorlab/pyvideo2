Title: '"Some Experiences with Python-for-Android (Py4A)"'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
I will talk about some experiences about the API of the Scripting Layer for
Android (SL4A) which is included in the Python-for-Android Package. The
simplicity of the SL4A API lets students code mobile Python programs in a
quick and easy way. Some properties of the Android GUI and the underlying
Linux are discussed using an GPS tracking application and some standard Python
applications like the Web Application Framework Web2py. This talk is intended
for beginners who have some experience with Python but none with Android and
the Py4A library. Itâ€™s not going into details, but more on how easy it was,
porting Python code on Android and using especially the Android GUI with the
Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A).
