py.test II - cross-platform and distributed testing (part 2 of 3)

  
Want to know more about advanced automated testing with Python? Use a tool
that allows you to ad-hoc distribute tests to multiple CPUs for speed and to
multiple platforms for compatibility checks? With tons of debugging help in
failure situations? This tutorial provides in-depth information on advanced
usages of the popular py.test tool. We highlight its current feature set
including using and writing extensions for generating HTML pages, testing
Javascript or ReST documents. We showcase and discuss ways of distributing
tests across CPUs and platforms and will leave time to discuss and tackle
specific scenarios brought up during the session. The tutorial format will be
an interactive lecture with plenty of time for questions.
