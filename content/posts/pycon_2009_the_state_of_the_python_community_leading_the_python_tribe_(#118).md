Title: '"PyCon 2009: The State of the Python Community: Leading the Python tribe (#118)"'

Steve Holden, Chairman of the Python Software Foundation, reflects on the
meaning of the phrase "the Python community" and the changes that have taken
place in the PSF in the last year. He discusses further possible changes that
could turn the PSF into a more "community-facing" organization, and solicits
your input on what kind of projects and activities it should be supporting.
