Customizing the Django Admin

Presented by Peter Baumgartner, and Michael Trythall

How to build great admin user interfaces while still leveraging the power of
the Django's batteries-included admin.

Abstract

The Django admin interface is a great tool for rapidly viewing and generating
content, but its default one size fits all approach may not be the best for
the users of it.

This talk is broken into two parts. First, we will discuss user experience and
what users have come to expect from an admin tool. In the second half, we'll
show you how to bend Django's admin to meet those expectations.
