Alternative views

Ben Firshman

Exploring the power of class-based views, their current status and how the
concepts behind them can be applied to other areas.

Abstract

Generic views are quickly outgrown for all but the most simple of
applications. They are often rewritten from scratch just to make small changes
to functionality.

If you use class-based views, code can be reused by inheriting from more
abstract views. They are provided with many reusable applications, but all
implemented in slightly different ways. It has been suggested a set of views
be supplied with Django to standardise the API.

I will present some of the advantages and disadvantages of using class-based
views, and how they can help you develop more flexible applications in less
time.
