Technical Design Panel

Featuring Justin Braun, Karen Tracy, Russel Keith-Magee, Brian Rosner, Janis
Leidel, Gary Wilson

Come one! Come all! Pay sixpence to see the freaks! Real Live Core Developers,
answering questions for your edification!

Abstract

This is a repeat of the ever-popular "hit the core developers with hard
questions" panel.

Covers issues brought up by Eric's talk, checkin rights, portable apps, the
global settings file, backwards incompatible changes, contrib, educating users
on finding tools and libraries, what's coming in django 1.3, memory usage in
django, required resources for django core development, best part of django
today, and problems with external dependencies not shipped with django.
