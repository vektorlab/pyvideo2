How to sell Django

Featuring Frank Wiles, Daniel Greenfeld, Peter Baumgartner, James Tauber,
Steve Holden

It seems that a lot of people want to use Django (and Python), but their
customer, management, or organization won't let them. Django is a great tool,
but it can be challenging to get in the door. This panel will explore how
companies and individuals have successfully introduced Django, what tools are
available to sell Django, and what pitfalls there are to avoid.

Possible questions will include:

  * What is a good example success story you can share? 
  * How do you deal with organizations that have already spent bucketloads of money on a piss-poor technology stack, are hurting for it, but can't seem to let go? 
  * How do you fight Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt (FUD) spread by people who stand to lose from introducing Django? 
  * What tools are available to help sell Django?
