Treehugging

Presented by Brian Luft

Hierarchical data sprouts up almost everywhere, but not all trees look alike.
Learn to how tell them apart and love them all in Django.

Abstract

This talk would cover some common examples of hierarchical data in web
applications and then review solutions like django-mptt and django-treebeard.
Rather than trying to cover tree algorithms in-depth, the focus would be on
best practices for querying and rendering trees in your Django apps.

This talk is not geared for the smart kids; they already know this stuff. It
is intended to help less experienced developers take advantage of patterns
without needing to worry about the deeper concepts.
