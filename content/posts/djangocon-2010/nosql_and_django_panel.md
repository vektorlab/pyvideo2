NoSQL and Django Panel

Featuring Jacob Burch, Russel Keith-Magee, Noah Silas, Michael Richardson,
Eric Florenzano, Curt Micol

A panel to discuss the future of no-sql/non-related databases in Django.

Abstract

The proliferation of non-SQL speaking datastores has caused a lot of discourse
and debate over their potential role in Django's decidedly SQL-speaking ORM.
The goal of this panel is to consolidate and discuss the root questions of
this debate.

The panel will consist of Django orm contributors and heavy end-users of both
Django and a variety of NoSQL database solutions. Questions to the panel will
briefly cover the NoSQL movement in general and it's staying power. After that
introduction to the debates at hand outside of Django, questions will shift to
focus closely on the issues into integrating NoSQL and Django--both on current
best practices and future plans for integrating it into the core.
