Title: '"Django Form Processing Deep Dive "'
date: '2012-03-10'
---
Django Form processing often takes a back seat to flashier, more visible parts
of the framework. But Django forms, fully leveraged, can help developers be
more productive and write more cohesive code. This talk will dive deep into
the stock Django forms package, as well as discuss a strategy for abstracting
validation for forms, and the use of unit and integration tests with forms.
