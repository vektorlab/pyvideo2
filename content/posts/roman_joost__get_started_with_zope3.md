Abstract

The talk introduces Zope 3, the main differences to Zope (2) and how to get

The Zope application server exist for nearly a decade now. One of the biggest
changes to the Zope architecture was the rewrite of the framework and an
introduction of a component architecture. Zope 3 was born. The talk covers how
developers can bootstrap a Zope 3 project using buildout, what the differences
between Zope (2) and Zope 3 is, how views and models are created and
registered, how third party applications are used and how common pitfalls can
be avoided.
