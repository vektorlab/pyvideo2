A Configuration Comparison in Python

  
Presented at PyCon 2009 by Terry Peppers

  
When faced with the simple task of figuring out how to use configuration to
your advantage in Python there are a myriad of methods. The purpose of this
talk is to walk through the standard library modules and the popular Python
Package Index modules comparing and contrasting configuration formats and the
code that consumes them. Specifically, I would like to walk through the use of
the csv module, the ConfigParser module, ConfigObj, lxml, PyYaml and
SimpleJSON.
