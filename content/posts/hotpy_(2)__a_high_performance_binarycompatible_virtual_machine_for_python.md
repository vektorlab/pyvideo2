HotPy (2) is a new interpreter for Python. It is binary compatible with
CPython and reuses CPython’s object and module implementations. The core
interpreter is new and uses many of the techniques developed during the 1990s
and 2000s plus a technique developed during my PhD. Once the first stage of
the optimisation chain is completed (May or June), HotPy is expected to be
between 2 and 3 times as fast as CPython. It will probably never be as fast as
PyPy, but it might be possible to get close. During the talk I will explain
how it works (with lots of pictures), and how it compares to CPython and PyPy.
I will also discuss whether the techniques used in HotPy would be suitable for
Jython and IronPython.
