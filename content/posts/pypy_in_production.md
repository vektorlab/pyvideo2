The PyPy project has recently gathered a lot of attention for its progress in
speeding up the Python language - it is the fastest Python interpreter, and
the most compatible and most stable 'alternativeÂ´ one. No longer merely a
research project, PyPy is now suitable for production use. We are working on
improvements on calling into C libraries and generally integrating with the
existing Python extensions ecosystem.

We will give an overview on how the tracing Just-in-Time compiler works in
PyPy. From there, we will then focus on what the PyPy project has achieved,
particularly in the past two years:

  * most Python benchmarks run much faster than with CPython or Psyco

  * the real-world PyPy compiler toolchain itself (200 KLocs) runs twice as fast

  * already supports 32 and 64bit x86 and is in the process of supporting ARM

  * full compatibility with CPython (more than Jython/IronPython)

  * full (and JIT-ed) ctypes support to call C libraries from Python

  * supports Stackless Python (in-progress)

  * new "cpyext" layer which integrates existing CPython C extensions

  * an experimental super-fast JIT-compilation of calls to C++ libraries

We want to reserve time for discussing potential future work like SWIG and/or
Cython compatibility and other areas brought up by the audience. There are
many interesting details that can be explored further; we will focus on the
points the audience is most interested in.
