In this tutorial, I will cover how to write very fast Python code for data
analysis. I will briefly introduce NumPy and illustrate how fast code for
Python is written in SciPy using tools like Fwrap / F2py and Cython. I will
also describe interesting new approaches to creating fast code that is leading
changes to NumPy on a fundamental level.
