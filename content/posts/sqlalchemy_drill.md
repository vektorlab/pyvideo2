Title: '"SQLAlchemy Drill"'
date: '2014-07-23'
---
In this talk will introduce the audience to SQLAlchemy in a well structured way, so that basic concepts are understood. This talk will be a combination of slides and interactive code editing in IPython. Both the working of SQLAlchemy as well as best practices in using SQLAlchemy will be demonstrated.

I will demonstrate the basic workings of:

* the SQL generation layer
* the DDL generation
* the ORM
* the session
* transactions

The used code will allow those who have their laptop with them to try
the code samples for themselves.
