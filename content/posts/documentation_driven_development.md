Documentation Driven Development

Presented by Corey Oordt

Developers usually leave documentation as a final step; one that they will get
to as soon as they are forced with threats of bodily harm. Writing the
documentation before writing the code, can lead to better code, better
implementation and, of course, actual documentation.

Abstract

"Documentation Driven Design" was coined by our team after noticing how
documenting code dramatically changed how we approached problems. By writing
the documentation first, you saw the problem from a different perspective: the
end user or programmer. This talk will focus on a few items:

Usable, not just functional. Many times developers write code that solves the
problem, but is a real pain in the neck to use. Writing the documentation
first demonstrates how easy or difficult it is to implement the solution right
away.

A guide to what to write. Many developers leave documentation undone because
they don't know how to approach it. Having some idea of what needs writing can
make the task seem less daunting.
