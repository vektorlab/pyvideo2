Title: 'Twisted tutorial part 2'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
Twisted is one of the best asynchronous network programming frameworks out
there, and can help you build cool stuff very easily, once you understand the
core design. Unfortunately, Twisted is also a huge framework and can be very
daunting for beginners to approach. This training session aims to help people
with little or no asynchronous programming experience understand both Twisted
and asynchronous programming. The plan is to cover core asynchronous topics,
the Twisted way, and as many practical applications as we can cover, including
web services, IPC, GUI applications etc. The audience should be competent in
core Python constructs. No previous asynchronous or threading programming
experience required. This is a repeat of the popular EuroPython 2011 Twisted
Tutorial, improved after feedback.
