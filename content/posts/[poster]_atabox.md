The Atabox is an $8 computer based of the Atmega328. It runs the webLinux Os and supports the bitlash and c programming languages. I am hoping to port python to the platform but have had no luck so far. It costs $8-$10 dollars. The interface is command line, but supports further graphical modifications.
