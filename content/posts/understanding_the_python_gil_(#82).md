Understanding the Python GIL

  
Presented by David Beazley

  
The Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a frequent source of debate and
concern for programmers working with threads and concurrency. Although most
Python programmers generally know that the GIL restricts Python's ability to
utilize multiple CPUs, few know the inner details of how it actually works and
how it impacts applications. This talk will dive into the inner workings of
the GIL like you've never seen before. Topics include details about the
execution of the Python interpreter, thread implementation, the GILs
surprising behavior on multicore CPUs, and more.
