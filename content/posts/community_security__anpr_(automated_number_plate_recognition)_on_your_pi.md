The target audience for this tutorial will be attendees who are interested in using single board computers (Raspberry Pi2) as a security measure in their community. The technical level of the tutorial will be suitable for beginners / intermediate level. 

The tutorial will consist of the following:

* Quick overview of project
* Installing OpenCV
* Installing ANPR framework
* Connecting the IP cameras
* Configuring the ANPR (training)
* Retrieving data
