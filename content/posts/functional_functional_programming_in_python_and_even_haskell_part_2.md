Title: 'Functional functional programming in Python and even Haskell part 2'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
Reaping the benefits of functional programming can be a real challenge,
falling anywhere between exciting and frustrating, to the point that one might
end up feeling demotivated and embarrassed about writing in the functional
style in the “real world”. I have always strived to write functional side-
effect free code for production, and this year I have been taking functional
programming for myself one step further by re-writing some of my Python tools
in Haskell, and I would like to share my findings. In this tutorial we will
work through a progression of increasing in complexity fun-to-solve problems,
obtain solutions both in Python and Haskell, in order to be able to first hand
compare and contrast readability, performance and development time. Bring a
laptop and a couple of interpreters (ipython and ghci) and lets do some
hacking!
