I will show in this talk some tips, tricks and best practices for some
recurring patterns in the django application development.

This is not a list of tools and applications, but rather a homemade summary of
code snippets and design best practices. All in all, the goal is: no mistakes
and go faster.

Topics include: python, users, forms, jquery, virtualenv, distribute,
buildbot, etc. â€¦
