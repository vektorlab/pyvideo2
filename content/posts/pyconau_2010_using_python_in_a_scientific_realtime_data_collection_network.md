Using Python in a scientific real-time data collection network

Presented by Dr. Paul Dyson (Bureau of Meteorology)

Python is being increasingly used within the Solar and Terrestrial Radiation
Network at the Bureau of Meteorology. This Network consists of ten ground
stations across Australasia that track the sun, measuring the irradiance of
the sun and sky. This talk will outline the work of the Network, the changes
resulting from the introduction of Python in 2005, and advantages and some
difficulties of using Python.
