Revisioned Databases for MultiUser Editing

  
Presented by John Rittenhouse (CCP Games)

  
At CCP Games (www.ccpgames.com), we work on large MMO projects with tens of
content editors editing the same data. To make this possible, we created a
Revisioned Database framework that allows for us to create new multiuser
editing systems without data synchronization between users having to be a
major concern. In this talk, solutions we've tried are discussed, the basic
layout of our revision database shown, the Python layer which handles it
transparently for the programmer detailed, and how the Python layer is used in
practice. All of this is focused on discussing what worked well and what
pitfalls we ran into during development.
