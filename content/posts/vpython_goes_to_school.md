My presentation is focused mainly on my teaching experience in a high school using VPython. I've posed some problems to my students to solve with VPython: from basic static building representations like castle to more complex dynamic models like bouncing balls.
This approach seems a good way to get in touch with computer programming concepts and to link computer science with other disciplines like Math, Geometry, Physics, Chemistry
