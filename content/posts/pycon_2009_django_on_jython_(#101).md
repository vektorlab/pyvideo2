[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: house audio] Django is the most popular Python web
framework, and the final release of Jython 2.5 should be available a couple of
months before PyCon. This means we can now use a modern Python web framework
on top of Java infrastructure by running Django on Jython. In this talk, we
will show examples of how to use this combination, engage a discussion about
what can take the Python (and Django) community from the Java world,
especially the necessary infrastructure bits, and how a Django/Jython stack
compares with other JVM web stacks like JRuby on Rails.
