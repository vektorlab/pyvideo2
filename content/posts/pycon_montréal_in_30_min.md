date: '2015-10-01'

This will be a whirlwind overview of some of the most interesting talks from this year's big PyCon in Montr√©al. The goal is to boil down the gist of my 10 favourite talks into a single, super-charged talk that gives you a good idea of what went down, but without getting stuck on any particular topic.
