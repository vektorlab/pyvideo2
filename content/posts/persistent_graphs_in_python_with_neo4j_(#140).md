Persistent Graphs in Python with Neo4j

  
Presented by Tobbias Ivarsson

  
Databases that employ a data model other than the relational model are
increasingly a hot topic. Neo4j is an open source database where the data
model is a graph. Data in Neo4j is stored as Nodes and Relationships in
between nodes. A lot of the data we model in applications every day is
actually graph oriented, having a database that persists such data natively is
a huge benefit. In this presentation we will see how to use Neo4j in Python,
and demonstrate this with a web application in Django.
