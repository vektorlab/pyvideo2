Connascence is the taxonomy of coupling: it allows us to specify how two or more pieces of code are connected, and suggests ways of minimising the impact of that coupling. Ultimately this allows developers to write software that is more flexible to change.

At the end of the talk the audience will have learned some of the forms of connascence with real python code examples, and will understand how to apply those principles to their own code.
