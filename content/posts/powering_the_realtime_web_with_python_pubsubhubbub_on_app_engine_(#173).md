Powering the real-time web with Python: PubSubHubbub on App Engine

  
Presented by Brett Slatkin

  
PubSubHubbub is an open protocol that turns Atom and RSS feeds into real-time
streams. I built the reference Hub run by Google using Python and App Engine.
In this talk you will learn how I made the real-time system work: An intro to
the protocol, asynchronous processing on App Engine, fault-tolerance, and
scalability.

  
For details on PubSubHubbub and the Hub's source code, see [http://code.google
