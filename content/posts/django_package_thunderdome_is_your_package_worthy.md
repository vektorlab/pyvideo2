Django Package Thunderdome: Is Your Package Worthy

Audrey Roy, Daniel Greenfeld

What makes a package useful? What is it about certain packages that makes them
must-haves for any project? Iâ€™ll go over topics like: purpose, structure,
docs, tests, availability on PyPI and Github/Bitbucket, activity, and more. I
will visit some of the most useful grids on djangopackages.com and highlight
my top package picks, showing examples of what makes these top packages so
great.
