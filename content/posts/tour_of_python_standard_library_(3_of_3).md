Title: '"Tour of Python Standard Library (3 of 3)"'

Welcome to A Tour of Python Standard Library. Together let us explore the
various modules, which will help you to build robust working programs. Once
you know about a particular library well, you will start replacing those 20
odd lines of code you used to write with a 2-3 lines and feel safe that your
code will now work on all the platforms that Python supports. Just like the
galaxy, the Python Standard Library is vast and when hitch-hiking I will take
you through some important ones that happen to be used most often. You can
explore, ask questions, experiment through out the ride. Welcome! And let the
journey begin.
