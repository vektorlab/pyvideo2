Title: '"Flexing SQLAlchemy''s Relational Power"'
date: '2012-03-10'
---
How do you take the big step from casual SQLAlchemy user, who treats your
database as a mysterious object store, to advanced power user, who optimizes
critical queries, plans indexing and migrations, and generates efficient
reports? This talk will teach you how databases think; why humanity invented
the Relational Algebra; and how SQLAlchemy grants you access to relational
power.
