Title: '"Full text search for trac with apache solr"'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
Trac is a widely used integrated bug, wiki and source control interface for
managing software projects. Itâ€™s very extensible and a wide range of plugins
are available. We shall present a newly written full text search plugin for
Trac that uses Apache Solr to make all parts of trac searchable - including
the source code repository and all file attachments. The session will
introduce Solr and show how it can be integrated into a Python project
-including the pitfalls to avoid and the more useful features.
