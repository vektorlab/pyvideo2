As Python becomes more popular, more users are wanting IDEs that provide code
completion, integrated source code control, project management, and other
developer tools. This panel includes representatives from a number of Python-
specific or Python-supporting IDE vendors, showing the ways that IDEs can
speed up development on any platform.

Abstract

For many developers, IDEs are an essential tool-just as essential as source
code control. The growth of Python in recent years has led to a number of
projects and vendors developing Python-specific or Python-supporting IDEs.
This panel will allow attendees to compare and contrast the different IDEs
available.
