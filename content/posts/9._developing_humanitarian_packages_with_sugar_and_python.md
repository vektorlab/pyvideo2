FOSS@RIT is an applied research lab at Rochester Institute of Technology
focused on promoting free/open source software and open web technologies. The
lab helped create a series of classes which have resulted in several
educational games and tools written in Python for the Sugar desktop
environment. Come learn more about our students' projects and how open source
