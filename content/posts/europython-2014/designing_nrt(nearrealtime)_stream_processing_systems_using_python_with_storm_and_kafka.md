Title: 'Designing NRT(NearRealTime) stream processing systems: using python with
  Storm and Kafka'
date: '2014-07-22'
---
The essence of near-real-time stream processing is to compute huge volumes of data as it is received. This talk will focus on creating a pipeline for collecting huge volumes of data using Kafka and processing for near-real time computations using Storm.
