Pieter will talk about the urgent push towards a decentralized future.  As founder of the ZeroMQ community, he will explain the vision, design and reality of distributed software systems. He'll explain his view on the community itself, also a highly decentralized "Living System", as Hintjens calls it. Finally he'll talk about edgenet, a model for a decentralized Internet.
