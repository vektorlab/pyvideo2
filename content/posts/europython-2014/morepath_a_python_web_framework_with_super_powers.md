Title: 'Morepath: a Python Web Framework with Super Powers'
date: '2014-07-24'
---
[Morepath](http://morepath.readthedocs.org) is a new server web
framework written with modern, rich client web development in mind.

In the talk I will be discussing some core features of Morepath that
make it different:

* Its different take on routing and linking. Morepath has support
  to help you construct hyperlinks to models.
* Its view system: plain views, generic views, view composition.
* Morepath's approach to application construction allows application extension and overriding, and composition.

This talk will attempt to convince people to try Morepath. For those
unable or unwilling to try, I will communicate some design principles
behind Morepath which can be of help to any web developer.
