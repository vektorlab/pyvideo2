Title: 'One year of Snowden, what''s next?'
date: '2014-07-21'

They systematically tapped international communications on a scale that only few people could imagine. But what are the consequences for societies when they now know about the NSA metadata repository capable of taking in billions of "events" daily to collected and analyze? Is there a way to defend against an agency with a monstrous secret budget?
