With the kernel [inotify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify "inotify") feature, the [D-Bus mocker library](https://launchpad.net/python-dbusmock "D-Bus mocker library") and the [udev monitoring](http://pyudev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/pyudev.html#pyudev.Monitor "udev monitoring") we try to detect the different events that occours when you're using a specific set of connected devices.

Then we try to mimic these devices investigating also the kernel drivers if necessary.

At the end we're ready to connect the simulation routines to our testing procedure.
