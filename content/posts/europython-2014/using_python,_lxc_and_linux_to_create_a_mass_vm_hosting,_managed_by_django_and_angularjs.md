Title: 'Using python, LXC and linux to create a mass VM hosting, managed by django
  and angularjs'
date: '2014-07-22'
---
How we created a scalable mass VM hosting for open source web apps with python, LXC and linux with a web-UI based on django and angularjs. We'll show the underlying architecture of this service, several linux internals that make this possible and we'll talk about bitter failure during development. This talk will be python- and linux-centric with some hints for integrating angularjs into django.
