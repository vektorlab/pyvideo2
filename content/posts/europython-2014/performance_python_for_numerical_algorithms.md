Title: 'Performance Python for Numerical Algorithms'
date: '2014-07-23'
---
This talk is about several approaches to implement high performing numerical algorithms and applications in Python. It introduces into approaches like multi-threading, parallelization (CPU/GPU), dynamic compiling, high throughput IO operations.

The approach is a practical one in that every approach is illustrated by specific Python examples.

The talk uses, among others, the following libraries:

* NumPy
* numexpr
* IPython.Parallel
* Numba
* NumbaPro
* PyTables
