What is Web Scraping ?
==================
Web scraping (web harvesting or web data extraction) is a 
computer software technique of extracting information from 
websites.  - Wikipedia

###In simple words :
It is a method to extract data from a website that does not 
have an API or we want to extract a LOT of data which we 
can not do through an API due to rate limiting.

We can extract any data through web scraping which we can 
see while browsing the web.

Usage of web scraping in real life.
============================
- to extract product information
- to extract job postings and internships
- extract offers and discounts from deal-of-the-day websites
- Crawl forums and social websites
- Extract data to make a search engine
- Gathering weather data etc

Advantages of Web scraping over using an API 
========================
- Web Scraping is not rate limited
- Anonymously access the website and gather data
- Some websites do not have an API
- Some data is not accessible through an API etc

Which libraries are available for the job ?
================================
There are numerous libraries available for web scraping in 
python. Each library has its own weaknesses and plus points.

Some of the most widely known libraries used for web scraping are:

- BeautifulSoup
- html5lib
- lxml
- re ( not really for web scraping, I will explain later )
- scrapy ( a complete framework )

A comparison between these libraries
==============================
- speed
- ease of use
- what do i prefer
- which library is best for which purpose

==================
- a list of proprietary scrapers
- their price
- are they really useful for you ?

Working of proprietary alternatives
===========================
- how they work (render javascript)
- why they are not suitable for you
- how custom scrapers beat proprietary alternatives
