Large Problems in Django, Mostly Solved

Presented by Eric Holscher

This talk is based on my popular series of blog posts highlighting
applications from the community. I will highlight some of the best
applications that the Django/Python community has put together, talk about
places that are lacking, and talk about what these popular applications have
in common.

Part 1

I have written a series of blog posts about "Large problems" in the community,
and how they have been solved by members of our community with reusable apps.
Previously I have covered:

  * Delayed Execution 
  * Search 
  * APIs 
  * Documentation 
  * Database Migrations 

I will update my thoughts on these issues, as well as talking about a couple
of other new issues that I think that have been solved in a decent way. These
include:

  * Remote Command Execution 
  * Debugging in Development 
  * Continuous Integration 

Part 2

In this part I will highlight issues that are still headaches for the
Community. These are places where there is a good chance for growth for third
party apps, and places where I have personally found some friction in my
development. A couple examples of this are:

  * Deployment 
  * Class Based Views / Thread Safety 
  * Debugging Production Environments 

Part 3

From the above applications that are well done, what makes a popular reusable
app? This won't be my thoughts, but more looking at apps that have been
successful and trying to see what they have in common. A good app and a good
reusable app are necessarily different, and I think it will be interesting to
look at what traits make reusable apps popular.
