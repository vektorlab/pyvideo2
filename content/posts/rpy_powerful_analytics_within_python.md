Title: '"RPy: Powerful Analytics within python"'
date: '2012-08-22'
---
R is an incredibly powerful statistical programming language. It is the choice
for powerful set and forgets analytics. However it is a specialist language
without strong functionality in other areas. In areas where significant
preprocessing of data, or where the statistics produced are part of a larger
system such as looking for patterns in the load behaviour of a web server, a
match with a strong general language is an obvious solution. Because of its
wide use and potential integration with R, python is that language.

This talk will be targeted at python programmers who wish to integrate
statistical and data analysis into their work, providing options for real time
data monitoring and analysis. This talk is accessible for anyone with a basic
understanding of python.
