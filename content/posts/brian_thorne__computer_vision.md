Computer Vision

Presented by Brian Thorne

Abstract

An introduction to computer vision in Python, from the general concept to its
implementation with some current open-source libraries (opencv, scipy,
pygame).

Outline

The purpose of my presentation is an introduction to computer vision (CV) and
image processing in Python. I will aim to show what is possible with current
libraries, demonstrate their usability, explore their limitations, and cover
elements of best coding practice. Firstly, I will briefly present the basics,
such as video grabbing, image processing and computer vision algorithms. I
will illustrate my presentation with the Python bindings to the opencv library
and show different examples such as displaying a video image, some filtering
algorithms (dilation, gaussian blur), and how to implement facial recognition.
I will describe after how related tasks can be achieved with other Python
tools such as scipy and pygame. I will show how these three libraries can be
used in conjunction to perform video capturing, image processing and user
interfacing. Finally, I will introduce my basic Python computer vision
framework, which is aimed at inexperienced users, and demonstrate it on the XO
laptop, the inexpensive low-powered sub-notebook distributed as part of the
One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative.
