IPython is widely used in the scientific community, but its various tools can
be used in any context. IPython gets you as close as possible to the Python
language, with an array of tools for productive work: at the terminal, in
GUIs, through a web browser, and in high-level parallel computing. This talk
will explain the design of IPython and provide short, hands-on demos of its
main features.
