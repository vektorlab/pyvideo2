Sometimes, the code you need just isn't available in Python, but someone's written some code in another language that solves your problem. What options do you have for interacting with this external code from within your program? We'll examine how to call external binaries, what happens behind the scenes at a systems level, and how these implementation details affect performance and memory usage. In the second part of the talk, we'll discuss the different options for more tightly integrating external code in the form of a C library for better performance and control.
