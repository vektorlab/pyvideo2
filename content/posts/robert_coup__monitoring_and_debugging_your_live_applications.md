Monitoring and debugging your live application

Presented by Robert Coup

Abstract

Ever wondered what is going on inside your app? Learn some tools and ideas you
can use for sussing it out.

Outline

Debugging issues in live applications can be a real nightmare. Add some more
logging, restart it, wait for the failure/load case and try and deduce a bit
more. Even with awesome test coverage you still need to debug those tricky
problems. This talk will introduce some ideas for monitoring and debugging
your live applications. The key things to cover are:

  * the standard logging module and learning how to drive it well. How to log effectively so it makes sense later, and what sorts of things we should be instrumenting and measuring. 
  * how to set up a remote console session into our running application, so we can interrogate variables and run code to figure out what's going on. 
  * how to incorporate IRC or IM bots so we can interact with our apps from the desktop, and how they can interact with us.
