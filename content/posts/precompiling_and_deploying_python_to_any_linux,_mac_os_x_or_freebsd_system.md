If a Python application has lots of dependencies and requires specific
versions of some of its dependencies, then users can easily get bored or
frustrated installing the application. To make the installation faster and
have less side effects, application authors can create bundles which contain
the application, all its dependencies and possibly the Python interpreter.
This talk presents a way of creating bundles using StaticPython, and compares
it to bb-freeze. StaticPython is a single-file statically linked version of
Python for 32-bit Linux (i386), containing all standard and some extra Python
modules and C extensions.
