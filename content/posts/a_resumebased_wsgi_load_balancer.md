Title: 'A resume-based WSGI Load Balancer'
date: '2012-03-09'
---
When a web application is large, it's a good idea to send different kinds of
requests to different servers to reduce the content corpus managed by each
server. A decentralized load balancing-based approach is presented in which
each application server keeps track of what it's good at and presents its
resume to load balancers, which use application server resumes to distribute
load.
