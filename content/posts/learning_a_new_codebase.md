Learning a new codebase

Presented by Justin Lilly

This talk will be on methods of reading code for comprehension. While the
project will be walking through various third-party Django apps, the
experiences and conclusions are drawn from joining a large, existing Django
project which lacked documentation.

Abstract

In the broadest sense, this talk is on how to read code. More than this, it is
a series of methods and practices which one can follow to get up to speed on a
new codebase. The subject of this talk will be open-sourced Django projects,
but many of the experiences which fuel this talk will be based on joining a
new team. It will cover tracing execution paths, finding the more interesting
portions of a codebase, as well as how to address any issues you may have
found in it.
