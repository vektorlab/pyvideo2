Don't Break It: Continuous Integration & Deployment

Presented by Benno Rice

So you've developed your application, it appears to work and you may even have
some tests to back that up. Now what?

One part of software development that tends to receive not nearly enough
attention is the process of deploying, supporting and maintaining your code in
production. This demonstration will give an overview of using tools such as
Hudson, nose, stdeb and freshen to automate the testing, packaging, deployment
and verification of production software.
