Some of the most significant changes in Python 3 are related to metaprogramming.  In this tutorial, I'll cover decorators, class decorators, descriptors, and metaclasses.  However, the focus will be on idioms and examples that are only made possible using features that are unique to Python 3.  For instance, making free use of function annotations, signatures, new metaclass features and more.
