Designing interfaces so that other code can interact with ours (whether our
code is a library, framework, application, websiteâ€¦) is a very common and
clearly crucial activity, but it's fraught with dangers - there's a lot stuff
we all keep doing wrong time after time. This talk shows some common
categories of API design errors encountered in the wild, with tips on how to
avoid them when you design your next API.

Goals: to show you how to focus resources and attention to help avoid mistakes
in API design. Prereqs: experience designing and developing software, esp.
software which needs to interact w/other existing software.
