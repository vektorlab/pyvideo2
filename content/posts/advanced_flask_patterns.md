Title: '"Advanced Flask Patterns"'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
This talk shows some interesting patterns for large scale Flask applications
and how Flask extension should be structured. It also dives into some of the
more unknown helpers in the Werkzeug and Jinja2 base libraries. The goal of
this talk is to share some of the things that the documentation canâ€™t explain
well by itself. Required prerequisites: basic knowledge of how Flask operates.
