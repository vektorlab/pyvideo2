Title: '"Spatial data and web mapping with Python"'
date: '2012-03-10'
---
Spatial data are often seen as opaque to most developers, and while dealing
with them does require a shift in approach from the data types we most
regularly handle, they neednâ€™t be the domain of specialists. High-quality
Python libraries and Python-based applications exist for operating on and
transforming spatial data, and for creating visualizations, including maps for
presentation on the web.
