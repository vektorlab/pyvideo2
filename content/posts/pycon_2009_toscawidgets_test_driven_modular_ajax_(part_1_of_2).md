[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: room's AC was loud] If you have ever struggled with having
to re-create the same content in multiple places in your web application it
might be time to look at ToscaWidgets. ToscaWidgets gives the developer the
ability to create reusable web content. This 3 hour lesson will cover
installation, integration, and usage of ToscaWidgets. After we have a handle
on how to create validated forms with ToscaWidgets, we will spend the second
half of this lesson creating a working ajax widget, which we will test the
client side component using ToscaWidget javascript technology.
