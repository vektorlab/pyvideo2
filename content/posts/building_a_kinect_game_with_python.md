Title: 'Building a Kinect game with Python'
date: '2012-03-10'
---
This talk will show you how to develop a game using Kinect from Python. I'll
start w/ an introduction to the Kinect API including skeleton tracking, normal
video, depth video, and audio APIs including speech recognition. I’ll then
show how the Kinect APIs can be incorporated into a game using PyGame. After
the talk you’ll be able to start developing your own Python based Kinect
games!
