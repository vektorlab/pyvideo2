The Mighty Dictionary

  
Presented by Brandon Craig Rhodes

  
Both newcomers and experienced developers alike love Python's built-in data
types â€” especially dictionaries! But how do dictionaries work? What do they
do better than other container types, and where, on the other hand, are their
weaknesses? Using simple, vivid diagrams that show the secrets of how the
dictionary is implemented, and a series of progressively interesting examples
of its behavior, we will train the Python developer's mind to picture what the
dictionary is doing in just enough detail to make good decisions, as your data
sets get larger, about when to use dictionaries and when other data structures
might be more appropriate.
