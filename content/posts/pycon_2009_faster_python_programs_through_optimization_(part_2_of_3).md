[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: vga blurry] Although Python programs may be slow for
certain types of tasks, there are many different ways to improve performance.
This tutorial will introduce optimization strategies and demonstrate
techniques to implement them. Another of the objectives of this course is to
give participants the ability to decide what might be the optimal solution for
a certain performance problem. Participants are strongly recommended to bring
laptops because all techniques are introduced with examples and exercises.
