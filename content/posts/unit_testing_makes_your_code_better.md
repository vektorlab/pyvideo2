Title: 'Unit Testing Makes Your Code Better'
date: '2014-04-13'

Unit testing is like public transit: everyone agrees it's a good thing for other people to do. It's easier to swallow when you see how unit testing improves not only the correctness of your code, but the design as well. I'll walk through a real-life case study where adding unit tests turned a pretty good module into an even better one: easier to understand, extend, and reuse.
