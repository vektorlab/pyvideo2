Title: '"Aspect oriented programming applied to dictionary trees"'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
Mixins enable code re-usage across class hierarchies, adapters allow for
additional run-time behaviour â€” metachao aspects merge these two concept and
go beyond: they can be applied to classes, instances and aspects themselves,
allowing for functional meta-programming in python. Their beauty will be
demonstrated by example of dictionary trees, where all behaviour is
implemented in form of aspects and applied to different dictionary
implementations. The goal of the talk is to get an understanding of how aspect
oriented programming can look and why dictionary trees in combination with
aspects are a cool way of designing applications.
