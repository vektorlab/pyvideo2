@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 2

**Audience level**

Novice

**Abstract**

Python + SQL/CSV + matplotlib + HTML make it possible to create flexible and sophisticated analyses of data from your spreadsheet or database. If you want to express something about your data, there is probably a way of doing it using these tools. The presentation will include both general principles and specific technical tips (who knew named tuples would be so useful!). Bring questions and enthusiasm. Data analysis should be fun.
