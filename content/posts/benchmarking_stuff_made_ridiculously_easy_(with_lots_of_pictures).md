(Mic issues for first ~1:30) Tennessee has been working on a module for
integrating cpu time management with unit testing using an easy-to-use
decorator. With all the options turned on, this will produce a a performance
history, tracked by revision, integrated with the software used to produce the
benchmarking graphs as used on&nbsp_place_holder;http://speed.pypy.org/. You
too can have this kind of shinyness for (almost) free!.
