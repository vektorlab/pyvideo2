There are currently multiple methods for packaging, distributing, discovering,
and installing Python software. This presentation will discuss the limitations
of the current methods, the efforts to standardize Python packaging, and
practical advice for developers to add support for the new packaging library,
distutils2 ("packaging" in Python 3.3+), to their software.
