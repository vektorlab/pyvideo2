Title: 'Writing Books using Python & Open Source Software'
date: '2011-07-13'

All of us are familiar with using open source tools to develop software
applications with, but instead of writing code, it is also possible to create
the manuscript of a book in very much the same way. These days, authors have
many choices in terms of the tools which are available to aid them in writing
a book. Gone are the times when the only option is using a proprietary word
processor, so why not try it using open source tools? It's especially
attractive to those who develop software using open source tools as well those
who are writing books about open source tools. Both code and the written word
are created in plain text files. These files are easily archived using some
version control system. They can be shared easily via e-mail and can also be
backed up in the same manner. In the end, the final product is shipped to the
customer: in the case of software, it's distribution via CD or DVD, or perhaps
a release for installation on a server, and for a book, it's delivering a
manuscript to the publisher, perhaps in a format such as HTML or PDF®.

Upon some reflection, writing a book is, in many ways, similar to writing an
application: you create text or code which is saved to a file (or files-
typically one but could be more) file in some format, proprietary or
otherwise. Additions, changes, or deletions are made to the file(s), which is
then updated when the file is (re)saved. Backups need to be made, some
versioning may be required to keep track of multiple files during the course
of development, and finally, the resulting file(s) have to be delivered, as
described above. Because of all the similarities described, we assert that it
is possible to use a development environment utilizing Python and other open
source tools to not only write application with, but also be able to create
the entire manuscript for a book as well! While this entire concept should not
really be mind-blowing, it does represent a trend seemingly growing in
popularity in the open source world.

In particular, we highlight the following requirements that are necessary when
creating a manuscript, especially with co-authors:

  * Text Formatting
  * Editing
  * Versioning and Backups
  * Automated Testing of Code
  * HTML/PDF® Generation
  * Author Communication

In this talk, we highlight one particular case study, the development of
Addison Wesley's 2009 publication, "Python Web Development with Django", as
well as provide some insight into other projects created using similar tools.
Open source software has radically affected how applications are built today,
and this phenomenon has the ability to affect the book publishing world in the
same way.
