Cross platform application development and distribution

  
Presented by Stani Michiels and Nadia Alramli

  
You think Python gives you native cross platform applications for free? Think
twice. Are you interested in distributing your application to other platforms
but not sure how?

  
We will give tips and examples on how to enhance the native feel of your
application: notifications, registration of file types and more. The talk will
also help you to avoid common pitfalls and provides solutions for designing
cross platform user interfaces. (Although we use wxPython as an example, the
principles are valid for other toolkits as well.) We'll show you where to
start if you want to distribute your application to different platforms,
briefly discussing tools like py2exe, py2app and Debian/Ubuntu packaging
ecosystem. This talk is based on our experience from developing Phatch (Photo
Batch Processor) and SPE (Python Editor).
