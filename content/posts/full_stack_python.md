This talk distills information from the open source guide [Full Stack Python](http://www.fullstackpython.com/) I wrote into a 30 minute talk on web stack layers. An approximate timeline for this talk would be:

* 5 min: intro story
* 5 min: what the web developers need to know about virtual servers, web servers, and WSGI servers
* 5 min: what do web frameworks provide?
* 5 min: what are the most important parts of your web application to analyze and monitor?
* 5 min: static files and execution on the user's browser
* 5 min: concluding story and resources to learn more

This is a high level overview intended for developers who are new to Python web development and need to understand what the web stack layers are and how they fit together.
