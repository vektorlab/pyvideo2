Title: '"Graph Databases in Python"'
date: '2012-11-11'
---

been traditionally designed to be used with Java or C. With some honorable
exceptions, there isn't an easy way to manage graph databases from Python. In

order to work with those new challenging databases, from our favorite languge,
Python.
