Ember is a JS framework based on established conventions that allows writing
complex applications with a small amount of code. Ember-data is the component
that connects this framework with a REST API. Unfortunately, the conventions
followed by its community are not compatible with Tastypie, one of the most
widely used Django libraries. This adapter makes all these technologies work
together.
