Esky: keep your frozen apps fresh

Presented by Ryan F Kelly

Esky ([http://pypi.python.org/pypi/esky/](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/esky/))
is an auto-update framework for frozen Python applications, designed to be
simple to use while guaranteeing the safety of your app in case of failed or
partial updates. It provides easy support for differential updates and is
compatible with py2exe, py2app, cx-freeze and bbfreeze.

This talk will give an overview of esky's features, and show how to extend an
existing frozen application with auto-update support.
