Python in Video Games and Multimedia Projects

Presented by Mr. Chris McCormick

This talk will cover several real-world uses of Python in cross platform video
game and multimedia projects, and the tips, tricks, and techniques I learned
along the way whilst working on those projects. I'll speak about the issues
involved in cross platform desktop dev with wxPython, interfacing with
multimedia programs using subprocess, spreading load with multiprocessing,
developing for the web on small devices with Django, and when and how to write
custom network servers using asyncore.
