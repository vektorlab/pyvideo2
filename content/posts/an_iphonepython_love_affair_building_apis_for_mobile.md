Mobile apps are the hot item of the day - and the best mobile apps are backed
by a great website. Python web developer Nate Aune and iPhone developer Anna
Callahan will show you how we built a simple music web app in Django with a
native iPhone app that communicates with it. Attendees of this talk will see a
concrete case study of building an application that exposes an API for mobile
devices.

Our web app exposes a JSON API for sending and receiving data from the mobile
device. We’ll talk about why we chose Django and the TastyPie API package, and
discuss other Python-based frameworks that could be used to build the API such
as Pyramid, Flask and Bottle. We’ll also compare REST and custom APIs to
understand best practices for building APIs designed for mobile devices.
