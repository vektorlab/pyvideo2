GeoDjango is the "world-class geographic web framework" everyone has probably
heard of. The purpose of this talk, targeted at people familiar with Django
itself, is to introduce in more details the capabilities of this framework.

After learning the basics of Geographic Information Systems, we will see:

  * how to get started with a GeoDjango installation,
  * how to import, store and query spatial data,
  * how to geo-enable your forms to allow user-generated spatial data,
  * how to serialize and display your data using the different formats and mapping frameworks such as OpenLayers and Polymaps.

During this talk we will be building a simple GeoDjango application to
illustrate the different concepts introduced.
