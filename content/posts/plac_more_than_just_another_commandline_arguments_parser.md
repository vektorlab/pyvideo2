plac is general purpose tool than can be used to define command-oriented
domain specific languages (DSLs). In its simplest form it can be used as a
command-line arguments parser with an easier-to-use API than argparse. It can
also be used to replace the cmd module in the standard library. Moreover it
can be used to automatize functional tests and for much more. The talk will
touch upon many use cases where plac can make your life as a developer simpler
and better. Technically Plac is a wrapper over argparse and works in all
versions of Python starting from Python 2.3 up to Python 3.2. In Python 3.X it
takes advantage of function annotations to define the parser in a declarative
way, instead of the imperative way of argparse. In Python 2.X it uses
decorators instead, to reach the same goal. The talk is a hands-on interactive
demonstration of plac capabilities.
