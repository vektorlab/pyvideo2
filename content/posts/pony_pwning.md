Adam Baldwin

Django's awesomeness unfortunately doesn't make it impenetrable. This talk
will cover common pitfalls of the Django developer as seen through the eyes of
a hacker or malicious user.

Abstract

Django is arguably the most secure web framework. The Django team have done an
excellent job making secure-by-default decisions for our web applications in
many situations. Still, the last mile in development is where the bulk of
security vulnerabilities can be introduced and Django's powerful flexibility
allows for plenty of rope for developers to hang themselves. Understanding the
vulnerabilities that can be created by common mistakes or misconceptions and
overlooked details in development will be useful for any Django user.
