Sprox: data driven web development

  
Presented by Jorge L Vargas

  
Sprox is a web frontend tool built to handle the creation and manipulation of
data.

  
Sprox is smart about your data. You should never write repetitive code again.
Sane defaults and easy overwrites is what makes Sprox guess what you need for
your fields.

  
This talk will give an overview of Sprox, what it does and how to use it. Then
we'll explore the available backends (SQLAlchemy, MongoDB) and dive into the
tgext.admin package, which is the "Admin Tool" for the TurboGears2 framework.
