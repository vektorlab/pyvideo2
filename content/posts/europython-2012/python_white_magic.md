Title: 'Python white magic'
date: '2012-07-04'

Python is a powerful language. Beginners appreciate its surface of simplicity
and ease to use, where (almost) everything “just works” (TM) as expected.
However, under the hood, there is a whole world of rules and layers which can
be (ab)used by experienced programmers to tweak the language in unexpected
ways. Often, these techniques are labeled as “hacks” or “black magic”, to
indicate that they should not used in production or that you should not look
at it unless you are “initiated” to some not better specified sorcery.
However, if used with care and in the right places, these techniques can lead
to better, faster and/or more readable code, or can be extremely useful during
debugging, and thus deserve the definition of “white magic” which programmers
can use to improve their code. Moreover, looking at how they are implemented
is a good way to learn about some of the deep corners of the language. This
talk presents some of these advanced techniques which I have seen in use in
real code, e.g. in PyPy or pdb++. Including, but not limited to: creating new
functions by reusing existing code objects, instantiating multiple copies of
the same module, playing with metaclasses in various ways, changing the
__class__ of an object on the fly to get specialized behavior, automatically
entering the debugger when a certain event occur, etc.
