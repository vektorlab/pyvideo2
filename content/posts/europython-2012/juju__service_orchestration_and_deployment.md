Title: 'Juju - Service orchestration and deployment'
date: '2012-07-04'
---
Juju is a new opensource configuration management and tool for deploying
services into a cloud and data center environments. Juju provides a higher
level semantic to its users of service level management rather than machine
management. By rethinking this focus, Juju is able to provide real reuse of
service definitions in much the same way that package management allows
deployment and reuse of software bits in many different context. Jujuâ€™s goal
is to be the apt of the clouds. By providing these higher level semantics to
end users, juju aims to be a preferred solution for deploying services to the
cloud. Underneath the hood, juju is written in python, but part of its beauty
is you can write service definitions in any language. Juju relies on zookeeper
for distributed coordination and state management of the managed machines, and
LXC for higher utilization of machines and minimal separation of deployed
services. It can deploy to physical machines as well as cloud environments
like AWS/EC2 and Openstack.
