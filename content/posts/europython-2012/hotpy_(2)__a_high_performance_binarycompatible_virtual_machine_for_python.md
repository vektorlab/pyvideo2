Title: 'HotPy (2) - A High Performance Binary-Compatible Virtual Machine for Python'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
HotPy (2) is a new interpreter for Python. It is binary compatible with
CPython and reuses CPythonâ€™s object and module implementations. The core
interpreter is new and uses many of the techniques developed during the 1990s
and 2000s plus a technique developed during my PhD. Once the first stage of
the optimisation chain is completed (May or June), HotPy is expected to be
between 2 and 3 times as fast as CPython. It will probably never be as fast as
PyPy, but it might be possible to get close. During the talk I will explain
how it works (with lots of pictures), and how it compares to CPython and PyPy.
I will also discuss whether the techniques used in HotPy would be suitable for
Jython and IronPython.
