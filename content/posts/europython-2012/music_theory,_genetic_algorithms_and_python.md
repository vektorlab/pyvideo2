Title: 'Music Theory, Genetic Algorithms and Python'
date: '2012-07-05'
---
I’ll explain how a genetic algorithm written in Python solves musical
exercises used to train composers. I’ll also embarrass myself by comparing the
computer generated results with solutions by the composers Johan Joseph Fux
and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The presented project is a fun “brain break”
based upon work I originally started at university. No prior musical knowledge
will be required as I intend to explain just enough musical theory for the
audience to understand the nature of the problem (although I’ll assume
familiarity with Python).
