Title: 'Faster python programs through optimization part 2'
date: '2012-07-05'

Objective This tutorial provides an overview of techniques to improve the
performance of Python programs. The focus is on concepts such as profiling,
diffrence of data structures and algorithms as well as a selection of tools an
libraries that help to speed up Python. Intended Audience Python programmers
who would like concepts to improve performance. Audience Level Programmers
with good Python knowledge. Prerequisites Please bring your laptop with the
operating system of your choice (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows). In addition to
Python 2.6 or 2.7, we need: RunSnakeRun ([http://www.vrplumber.com/programming
/runsnakerun](http://www.vrplumber.com/programming/runsnakerun)) Guppy_PE
framework ([http://guppy-pe.sourceforge.net](http://guppy-pe.sourceforge.net))
(<= Python 2.6 ) lineprofiler ([http://packages.python.org/line_profiler/](htt
p://packages.python.org/line_profiler/)) pympler
([http://code.google.com/p/pympler/](http://code.google.com/p/pympler/)) psyco
([http://psyco.sourceforge.net](http://psyco.sourceforge.net), Python 2.6
only, version 1.5.2 or higher) pypy ([http://pypy.org](http://pypy.org)) and
NumPy ([http://numpy.scipy.org](http://numpy.scipy.org), version 1.2 or
higher). Method This is a hands-on course. Students are strongly encouraged to
work along with the trainer at the interactive prompt. There will be exercises
the students need to do on their own. Experience shows that this active
involvement is essential for an effective learning. Outline How fast is fast
enough? Optimization guidelines Premature optimization Optimization rules
Seven steps for incremental optimization Optimization strategy Measuring in
stones Profiling CPU usage Profiling memory usage Algorithms and Anti-patterns
String concatenation List and generator comprehensions The right data
structure Caching The example Testing speed Pure Python Meet Psyco, the JIT
Using PyPy NumPy for numeric arrays Using multiple CPUs with multiprocessing
Combination of optimization strategies Results of different example
implementations I taught this tutorial multiple times and will update the
content as I regularly do.
