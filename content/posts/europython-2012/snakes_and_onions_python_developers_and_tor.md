The Tor Project develops and maintains Tor, a free and open-source software
that allows users to browse the web anonymously and securely. In addition, the
Tor Project also develops and maintains a number of Python applications
related to Tor, such as a command-line monitor, censorship scanner, network
simulator, controller library, and bridge distributor. In this talk, Runa A.
Sandvik will present the Tor Project, and talk about Tor and how it works. She
will also introduce some of the Python projects currently under development,
and explain how you can get involved and contribute with code, testing, and
documentation.
