Title: 'The integrator''s guide to duct-taping'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
“Duct-taping” different systems together is a common task, and is generally
regarded as “mostly harmless”. However, “duct-taping” hides much more pitfalls
than a cursory examination might reveal, especially when the constraints
outside the developer’s control are many. In this talk, a classification of
the different integration scenarios is presented, along with methodologies to
identify them and asses their complexity: those hiding the most dangerous
pitfalls will be examined in detail, and methodologies and best practices to
avoid them will be exposed, with a special care put into considerations about
security and scalability.
