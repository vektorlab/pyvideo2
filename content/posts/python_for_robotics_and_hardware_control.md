Title: '"Python for Robotics and Hardware Control"'

I build robots for a living and kinetic art for fun. I use Python as a front end, GUI control, and glue to talk to controllers, actuators, sensors, and peripherals.  I will present some example robots and kinetic art, and give some tips that I've learned from building everything from robotic desk lamps to automated surgical systems.
