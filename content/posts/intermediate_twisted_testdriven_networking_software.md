Title: 'Intermediate Twisted: Test-Driven Networking Software'
date: '2013-03-14'
---
Writing tests for networking code presents special challenges, which Twisted tries to address. In this tutorial you will implement a toy HTTP server using test-first methodology: first the tests are written, and then the code. You will learn how to write well-tested network applications using Twisted, and the general virtues of doing test-driven development.
