Title: '"Spotify, pipelining your music"'
date: '2012-07-04'

Spotify’s current catalog contains 15 million songs. Original storage of audio
and metadata is over 500 terabytes and we’re transcoding 500 000 new audio
streams a day. At it’s best the system can make an album playable just few
minutes after it’s delivery. This talk is about building the music pipeline,
all the way from the labels, who deliver music and metadata XML to our system,
to the clients. Problems here are the concurrency, massive amount of data,
enriching the metadata to provide better quality and to actually deliver 100
gigabytes of indexes daily.
