Title: '"Profiling for Performance"'
date: '2012-11-10'
---
We will discuss how to profile Python code, how to interpret profiles, and how
(and how not) to use profiling to improve your code's run-time performance. We
will look at both built-in and external tools (including RunSnakeRun and
SnakeViz). We will also discuss the wider issues of how to approach
optimization in your code base.
