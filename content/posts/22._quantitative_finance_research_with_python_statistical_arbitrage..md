Title: '"22. Quantitative Finance Research with Python: Statistical arbitrage."'
date: '2012-03-11'
---
Recently, many projects have been developed to make Python useful to do
quantitative finance research. We proposed us not only to show you the
integration of these tools to perform time series analysis and modeling, but
also to show you how we can search for cointegrated pairs of asset and set up
a statistical arbitrage strategy - pairs trading - to get potential profit
from financial market.
