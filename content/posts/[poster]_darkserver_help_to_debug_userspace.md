Darkserver is a set of tools and service written in Python to help developers to debug their applications & libraries. Darkserver project was started to use Build-ID feature of compiler toolchains and help developer tools to identify exact package builds from which process images (e.g. core dumps) come. This can enable their analysis, debugging profiling.
