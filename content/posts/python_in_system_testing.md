When you think about Python+testing, you usually think about testing your code - unittests, mostly. But it is not the only case! When you have a big system, you need to test it on much higher level - if only to check if all the components are wired in the right way. You may do it manually, but it is tedious and time-consuming - so you want to automate it. And here comes Python - the language of choice in many QA departments.

I will tell about differences between unittesting and system testing which result in totally different requirements on test management/running systems. I will tell how we use Python (and a little why) to automate our work. Finally, I will tell a little about my "idee fixe" - a framework for system testing written in Python.
