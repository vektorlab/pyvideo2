Panel: Python VMs

Presented by Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Brett Cannon, Maciej Fijalkowski, Frank
Wierzbicki, Dino Viehland

Python is lucky enough to have a healthy ecosystem of virtual machines (VMs)
exist. CPython, Jython, IronPython, and PyPy are all used extensively by
people in real-world situations. This panel brings together a representative
from each of the major VMs to discuss where they are now, going in the future,
and to answer questions from the community.

Abstract

All four major Python VMs will be represented:

  * [CPython](http://python.org/): Brett Cannon 
  * [Jython](http://www.jython.org/): Frank Wierzbicki 
  * [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/): Dino Viehland 
  * [PyPy](http://pypy.org/): Maciej Fijalkowski 
Moderation will be handled by Jacob Kaplan-Moss of Django.
