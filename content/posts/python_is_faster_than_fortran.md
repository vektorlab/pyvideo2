Title: '"Python is faster than fortran"'
date: '2012-07-06'
---
Many people may think that Python is slow because it is compiled to byte code.
This presentation shows that Python can be fast even for computational
intensive applications. In the example presented here, Python competes with
FORTRAN, a programming languages renowned for its performance and aggressively
optimizing compilers. Python offers powerful data structures such as sets that
make writing efficient algorithms extremely simple. FORTRAN on the other hand,
has much less in such support. For the given example, it takes considerably
more programming in FORTRAN than in Python to achieve similar execution times
for large data sizes. The comparison of program run times and lines of code,
which can be roughly translated into development effort, shows that Python can
actually be faster than FORTRAN under many circumstances typically found in
real life.
