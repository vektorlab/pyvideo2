The state of Packaging

  
Presented by Tarek Ziad√©

  
The Python Package Index (PyPI) became over the last years an essential tool
to share your Python programs. As long as you use Distutils standards, you can
register and upload your work at PyPI in a few seconds.

  
Projects like Setuptools and Pip added great features on the top of this : the
ability to fetch PyPI to install a project and its dependencies. So you can
"easy_install A-Program" and everything is done automatically for you.

  
But all these features have shown the flaws and limitations of the current
Distutils design, and the urgency to make it evolve with respect to the
existing OS-specific packaging systems.

  
This talk will detail the biggest issues that need to be solved, and the work
that is being done. It will end up with a presentation of the Distutils
roadmap, and an overview of the Distribute project, the Setuptools replacer.
