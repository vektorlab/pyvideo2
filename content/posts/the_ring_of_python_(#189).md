The Ring of Python

  
Presented by holger krekel (merlinux gmbh)

  
CPython 2.5/2.6/3.1, Jython, IronPython, PyPy, StacklessPython,
UnladenSwallow, Cython ... what do we make of all these cool interpreter
projects and versions? Where does competition help and where does it hamper?

  
In this interactive talk I'll highlight the main strengths of each of the
Python interpreters. Furthermore, I'll discuss ways to leverage Python
interpreters in a co-operative way, discuss challenges, projects and issues
ahead and also briefly highlight 'execnet', one my own projects for bridging
(Any) Python to (Any) Python. This is also the first time i am going to try
out a new and funvisual presentation technique after several years of having
done mostly text-based ones
