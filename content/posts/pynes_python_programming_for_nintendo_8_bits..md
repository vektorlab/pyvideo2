This lecture describes a journey guided by hardcore gaming experiences from the past and how that lead to development of PyNES. What started as a "Python ASM compiler for Nintendo 8 bits" and is now evolving as a "Python programming for Nintendo 8 bits". All the hacks and drawbacks faced will be shown. Told as an epic tale, that should encourage others to fulfil the same path.
