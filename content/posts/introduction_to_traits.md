Introduction to Traits

Presented by Corran Webster

The Traits project allows you to simply add validation, initialization,
delegation, notification and a graphical user interface to Python object
attributes. In this tutorial we will explore the Traits toolset and learn how
to dramatically reduce the amount of boilerplate code you write, do rapid GUI
application development, and understand the ideas which underly other parts of
the Enthought Tool Suite (such as MayaVi and Chaco plotting toolkits).

Traits and the Enthought Tool Suite are open source projects licensed under a
