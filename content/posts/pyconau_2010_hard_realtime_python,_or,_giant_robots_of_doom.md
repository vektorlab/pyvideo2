Hard Real-time Python, or, Giant Robots of Doom

Presented by Simon Wittber (Different Methods Pty Ltd)

Can you use Python to control a pair of 30 tonne robots as they spin at 72
kilometres per hour? Can you use Python to provide realtime collision
avoidance and fly-by-wire control?

Yes, you can. See how Perth based engineering company Transmin Pty Ltd
(www.transmin.com.au) used Python to deliver a safety-crticial robotic control
system in record time.
